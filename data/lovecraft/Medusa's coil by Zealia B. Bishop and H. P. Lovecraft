     __________________________________________________________________

   The drive toward Cape Girardeau had been through unfamiliar country;
   and as the late afternoon light grew golden and half dream-like I
   realized that I must have directions if I expected to reach the town
   before night. I did not care to be wandering about these bleak southern
   Missouri lowlands after dark, for roads were poor and the November cold
   rather formidable in an open roadster. Black clouds, too, were massing
   on the horizon; so I looked about among the long gray and blue shadows
   that streaked the flat, brownish fields, hoping to glimpse some house
   where I might get the needed information.

   It was a lonely and deserted country, but at last I spied a roof among
   a clump of trees near the small river on my right; perhaps a full
   half-mile from the road, and probably reachable by some path or drive
   upon which I would presently come. In the absence of any nearer
   dwelling, I resolved to try my luck there; and was glad when the bushes
   by the roadside revealed the ruin of a carved stone gateway, covered
   with dry, dead vines and choked with undergrowth which explained why I
   had not been able to trace the path across the fields in my first
   distant view. I saw that I could not drive the car in; so I parked it
   very carefully near the gate—where a thick evergreen would shield it in
   case of rain—and got out for the long walk to the house.

   Traversing that brush-grown path in the gathering twilight I was
   conscious of a distinct sense of foreboding, probably induced by the
   air of sinister decay hovering about the gate and the former driveway.
   From the carvings on the old stone pillars I inferred that this place
   was once an estate of manorial dignity; and I could clearly see that
   the driveway had originally boasted guardian lines of linden trees,
   some of which had died, while others had lost their special identity
   among the wild scrub growths of the region.

   As I plowed onward, cockleburrs and stickers clung to my clothes, and I
   began to wonder whether the place could be inhabited after all. Was I
   tramping on a vain errand? For a moment I was tempted to go back and
   try some farm farther along the road, when a view of the house ahead
   aroused my curiosity and stimulated my venturesome spirit.

   There was something provocatively fascinating in the tree-girt,
   decrepit pile before me, for it spoke of the graces and spaciousness of
   a bygone era and a far more southerly environment. It was a typical
   wooden plantation house of the classic, early Nineteenth Century
   pattern, with two and a half stories and a great Ionic portico whose
   pillars reached up as far as the attic and supported a triangular
   pediment. Its state of decay was extreme and obvious: one of the vast
   columns having rotted and fallen to the ground, while the upper piazza
   or balcony had sagged dangerously low. Other buildings, I judged, had
   formerly stood near it.

   As I mounted the broad stone steps to the low porch and the carved and
   four-lighted doorway I felt distinctly nervous, and started to light a
   cigarette—desisting when I saw how dry and inflammable everything about
   me was. Though now convinced that the house was deserted, I
   nevertheless hesitated to violate its dignity without knocking; so I
   tugged at the rusty iron knocker until I could get it to move, and
   finally set up a cautious rapping which seemed to make the whole place
   shake and rattle. There was no response; yet once more I plied the
   cumbrous, creaking device, as much to dispel the sense of unholy
   silence and solitude as to arouse any possible occupant of the ruin.

   Somewhere near the river I heard the mournful note of a dove, and it
   seemed as if the coursing water itself were faintly audible. Half in a
   dream, I seized and rattled the ancient latch, and finally gave the
   great six-paneled door a frank trying. It was unlocked, as I could see
   in a moment; and though it stuck and grated on its hinges I began to
   push it open, stepping through it into a vast shadowy hall as I did so.

   But the moment I took this step I regretted it. It was not that a
   legion of specters confronted me in that dim and dusty hall with the
   ghostly Empire furniture, but that I knew at once that the place was
   not deserted after all. There was a creaking on the great curved
   staircase, and the sound of faltering footsteps slowly descending. Then
   I saw a tall, bent figure silhouetted for an instant against the great
   Palladian window on the landing.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My first terror was soon over, and as the figure descended the final
   flight I was ready to greet the house-holder whose privacy I had
   invaded. In the semi-darkness I could see him reach into his pocket for
   a match. There came a flare as he lighted a small kerosene lamp which
   stood on a rickety console table near the foot of the stairs. The
   feeble glow revealed the stooping figure of a very tall, emaciated old
   man, disordered in dress and unshaven as to face, yet for all that with
   the bearing and expression of a gentleman.

   I did not wait for him to speak, but at once began to explain my
   presence.

   "You'll pardon my coming in like this, but when my knocking didn't
   raise anybody I concluded that no one lived here. I wanted to know the
   shortest road to Cape Girardeau. I wanted to get there before dark, but
   now, of course——"

   As I paused, the man spoke, in exactly the cultivated tone I had
   expected, and with a mellow accent as unmistakably Southern as the
   house he inhabited.

   "Rather, you must pardon me for not answering your knock more promptly.
   I live in a very retired way, and am not usually expecting visitors. At
   first I thought you were a mere curiosity-seeker. When you knocked
   again I started to answer, but I am not well and have to move very
   slowly, owing to spinal neuritis—very troublesome case.

   "As for your getting to town before dark—you can't do that. The road
   you are on isn't the best or shortest way. What you must do is to take
   the first real road to your left after you leave the gate. There are
   three or four cart-paths you can ignore, but you can't mistake the real
   road because of the large willow tree on the right just opposite it.

   "When once you've turned, keep on past two roads and turn to the right
   along the third. After that——"

   Perplexed by these elaborate directions, confusing indeed to a total
   stranger, I could not help interrupting.

   "Please, how can I follow all these clues in pitch-darkness, without
   ever having been near here before, and with only an indifferent pair of
   headlights to tell me what is and what isn't a road? Besides, I think
   it's going to storm pretty soon, and my car is an open one. It looks as
   if I were in a bad fix if I want to get to Cape Girardeau tonight. The
   fact is, I don't think I'd better try. I don't like to impose, but in
   view of the circumstances, do you suppose you could put me up for the
   night? I won't be any trouble. Just let me have a corner to sleep in
   till daylight, and I'm all right. I can leave the car in the road where
   it is; wet weather won't hurt it."

   As I made my sudden request I could see the old man's face lose its
   former expression of quiet resignation and take on an odd, surprised
   look.

   "Sleep here?"

   He seemed so astonished at my request that I repeated it.

   "Yes, why not? I assure you I won't be any trouble. What else can I do?
   I'm a stranger hereabouts, these roads are a labyrinth in the dark, and
   I'll wager it'll be raining torrents inside of an hour——"

   This time it was my host's turn to interrupt, and as he did so I could
   feel a peculiar quality in his deep, musical voice.

   "A stranger—of course you must be, else you wouldn't think of sleeping
   here; wouldn't think of coming here at all. People don't come here
   nowadays."

   He paused, and my desire to stay was increased a thousandfold by the
   sense of mystery his laconic words seemed to evoke. There was something
   queer about this place, and the pervasive musty smell seemed to cloak a
   thousand secrets. Again I noticed the extreme decrepitude of everything
   about me; manifest even in the feeble rays of the single small lamp. I
   felt woefully chilly, and saw with regret that no heating seemed to be
   provided; yet so great was my curiosity that I still wished most
   ardently to stay and learn something of the recluse and his dismal
   abode.

   "You may stay if you really wish to; you can come to no harm that I
   know of. Others claim there are certain peculiarly undesirable
   influences here. As for me, I stay because I have to."

   With my curiosity still more heightened, I prepared to take my host at
   his word, and followed him slowly upstairs when he motioned me to do
   so. It was very dark now, and faint pattering outside told me that the
   threatened rain had come. I would have been glad of any shelter, but
   this was doubly welcome because of the hints of mystery about the place
   and its master. For an incurable lover of the grotesque, no more
   fitting haven could have been provided.
     __________________________________________________________________

   There was a second-floor corner room in less unkempt shape than the
   rest of the house, and into this my host led me, setting down his small
   lamp and lighting a somewhat larger one. From the cleanliness and
   contents of the room, and from the books ranged along the walls, I
   could see that I had not guessed amiss in thinking the man a gentleman
   of taste and breeding. He was a hermit and eccentric, no doubt, but
   still had standards and intellectual interests. As he waved me to a
   seat I began a conversation on general topics, and was pleased to find
   him not at all taciturn. If anything, he seemed glad of someone to talk
   to, and did not attempt to swerve the discourse from personal topics.

   He was, I learned, one Antoine de Russy, of an ancient, powerful and
   cultivated line of Louisiana planters. More than a century ago his
   grandfather, a younger son, had migrated to southern Missouri and
   founded a new estate in the lavish ancestral manner; building this
   pillared mansion and surrounding it with all the accessories of a great
   plantation. There had been, at one time, as many as two hundred negroes
   in the cabins which stood on the flat ground in the rear—ground that
   the river had now invaded—and to hear them singing and laughing and
   playing the banjo at night was to know the fullest charm of a
   civilization and social order now sadly extinct. In front of the house,
   where the great guardian oaks and willows stood, there had been a lawn
   like a broad green carpet, always watered and trimmed and with
   flag-stoned, flower-bordered walks curving through it. Riverside (for
   such the place was called) had been a lovely and idyllic homestead in
   its day; and my host could recall it when many traces of its best
   period still lingered.

   It was raining hard now, with dense sheets of water beating against the
   insecure roof, walls, and windows, and sending in drops through a
   thousand chinks and crevices. Moisture trickled down to the floor from
   unsuspected places, and the mounting wind rattled the rotting,
   loose-hinged shutters outside. But I minded none of this, nor even
   thought of my roadster outside beneath the trees, for I saw that a
   story was coming. Incited to reminiscence, my host made a move to show
   me to sleeping-quarters, but kept on recalling older, better days.
   Soon, I saw, I might learn why he lived alone in that ancient place,
   and why his neighbors thought it full of undesirable influences. His
   voice was very musical as he spoke on, and his tale soon took a turn
   which left me no chance to grow drowsy.

   "Yes, Riverside was built in 1816, and my father was born here in 1828.
   He died young, so young I can just barely remember him. In '64, he was
   killed in the war—Seventh Louisiana Infantry, C.S.A.—for he went back
   to the old home to enlist. My grandfather was too old to fight, yet he
   lived on to be ninety-five, and helped my mother bring me up: good
   bringing-up, too, I'll give them credit. We always had strong
   traditions, high notions of honor, and my grandfather saw to it that I
   grew up the way de Russys have grown up, generation after generation,
   ever since the Crusades. We weren't quite wiped out financially, and
   managed to get on very comfortably after the war. I went to a good
   school in Louisiana, and later to Princeton. Later on I was able to get
   the plantation on a fairly profitable basis, though you see what it's
   come to now.

   "My mother died when I was twenty, and my grandfather two years later.
   It was rather lonely after that; and in '85 I married a distant cousin
   in New Orleans. Things might have been different if she'd lived, but
   she died when my son Denis was born. Then I had only Denis. I didn't
   try marriage again, but gave all my time to the boy. He was like me,
   like all the de Russys, darkish and tall and thin, and with the devil
   of a temper. I gave him the same training my grandfather had given me,
   but he didn't need much training when it came to points of honor. It
   was in him. Never saw such high spirit—all I could do to keep him from
   running away to the Spanish War when he was eleven! Romantic young
   devil, too full of high notions—you'd call 'em Victorian, now—no
   trouble at all to make him let the nigger wenches alone. I sent him to
   the same school I'd gone to, and to Princeton, too. He was Class of
   1909.

   "In the end he decided to be a doctor, and went a year to the Harvard
   Medical School. Then he hit on the idea of keeping to the old French
   tradition of the family, and argued me into sending him to the
   Sorbonne. I did—and proudly enough, though I knew how lonely I'd be
   with him so far off. Would to God I hadn't! I thought he was the safest
   kind of a boy to be in Paris. He had a room in the Rue St.
   Jacques—that's near the University in the Latin Quarter—but according
   to his letters and his friends he didn't cut up with the gayer dogs at
   all. The people he knew were mostly young fellows from home—serious
   students and artists who thought more of their work than of striking
   attitudes and painting the town red.

   "But of course there were lots of fellows who were on a sort of
   dividing line between serious study and the devil: the esthetes, the
   decadents, experimenters in life and sensation; the Baudelaire kind of
   a chap. Naturally, Denis ran up against a good many of these, and saw a
   good deal of their life. They had all sorts of crazy circles and
   cults—imitation devil-worship, false Black Masses, and the like. Doubt
   if it did them much harm on the whole—probably most of 'em forgot all
   about it in a year or two. One of the deepest in this queer stuff was a
   fellow Denis had known at school—for that matter, whose father I'd
   known myself. Frank Marsh, of New Orleans. Disciple of Lafcadio Hearn
   and Gauguin and Van Gogh—regular epitome of the yellow nineties. Poor
   devil—he had the makings of a great artist, at that.
     __________________________________________________________________

   "Marsh was the oldest friend Denis had in Paris; so as a matter of
   course they saw a good deal of each other, to talk over old times at
   St. Clair Academy, and all that. The boy wrote me a good deal about
   him, and I didn't see any especial harm when he spoke of the group of
   mystics Marsh ran with. It seems there was some cult of prehistoric
   Egyptian and Carthaginian magic having a rage among the Bohemian
   element on the left bank; some nonsensical thing that pretended to
   reach back to forgotten sources of hidden truth in lost African
   civilizations—the great Zimbabwe, and dead Atlantean cities in the
   Hoggar region of the Sahara—and that had a lot of gibberish connected
   with snakes and human hair. At least, I called it gibberish then. Denis
   used to quote Marsh as saying odd things about the veiled facts behind
   the legend of Medusa's snaky locks—and behind the later Ptolemaic myth
   of Berenice, who offered up her hair to save her husband-brother, and
   had it set in the sky as the constellation Coma Berenices.

   "I don't think this business made much impression on Denis until the
   night of the queer ritual at Marsh's rooms when he met the priestess.
   Most of the devotees of this cult were young fellows, but the head of
   it was a young woman who called herself Tanit-Isis, letting it be know
   that her real name—her name in this latest incarnation, as she put
   it—was Marceline Bedard. She claimed to be the left-handed daughter of
   Marquis de Chameaux, and seemed to have been both a petty artist and an
   artist's model before adopting this more lucrative magical profession.
   Someone said she had lived for a time in the West Indies—Martinique, I
   think—but she was very reticent about herself. Part of her pose was a
   great show of austerity and holiness, but I don't think the more
   experienced students took that very seriously.

   "Denis, though, was far from experienced, and wrote me fully ten pages
   of slush about the goddess he had discovered. If I'd only realized his
   simplicity I might have done something, but I never thought a puppy
   infatuation like that could mean much. I felt absurdly sure that Denis'
   touchy personal honor and family pride would always keep him out of the
   most serious complications.

   "As time went on, though, his letters began to make me nervous. He
   mentioned this Marceline more and more, and his friends less and less;
   and began talking about the 'cruel and silly way' they declined to
   introduce her to their mothers and sisters. He seems to have asked her
   no questions about herself, and I don't doubt but that she filled him
   full of romantic legendry concerning her origin and divine revelations
   and the way people slighted her. At length I could see that Denis was
   altogether cutting his own crowd and spending the bulk of his time with
   this alluring priestess. At her especial request he never told the old
   crowd of their continual meetings; so nobody over there tried to break
   the affair up.

   "I suppose she thought he was fabulously rich; for he had the air of a
   patrician, and people of a certain class think all aristocratic
   Americans are wealthy. In any case, she probably thought this a rare
   chance to contract a genuine right-handed alliance with a really
   eligible young man. By the time my nervousness burst into open advice,
   it was too late. The boy had lawfully married her, and wrote that he
   was dropping his studies and bringing the woman to Riverside. He said
   she had made a great sacrifice and resigned her leadership of the
   magical cult, and that henceforth she would be merely a private
   gentlewoman—the future mistress of Riverside, and mother of de Russys
   to come.

   "Well, sir, I took it the best way I could. I knew that sophisticated
   Continentals have different standards from our old American ones, and
   anyway, I really knew nothing against the woman. A charlatan, perhaps,
   but why necessarily any worse? I suppose I tried to keep as naïve as
   possible about such things in those days, for the boy's sake. Clearly,
   there was nothing for a man of sense to do but to let Denis alone so
   long as his new wife conformed to de Russy ways. Let her have a chance
   to prove herself—perhaps she wouldn't hurt the family as much as some
   might fear. So I didn't raise any objections or ask any penitence. The
   thing was done, and I stood ready to welcome the boy back, whatever he
   brought with him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   "They got here three weeks after the telegram telling of the marriage.
   Marceline was beautiful, and I could see how the boy might very well
   get foolish about her. She did have an air of breeding, and I think to
   this day she must have had some strain of good blood in her. She was
   apparently not much over twenty; of medium size, fairly slim, and as
   graceful as a tigress in posture and motions. Her complexion was a deep
   olive, and her eyes were large and very dark. She had small,
   classically regular features, though not quite clean-cut enough to suit
   my taste, and the most singular head of jet-black hair that I ever saw.

   "I didn't wonder that she had dragged the subject of hair into her
   magical cult, for with that heavy profusion of it the idea must have
   occurred to her naturally. Coiled up, it made her look like some
   Oriental princess in a drawing of Aubrey Beardsley's. Hanging down her
   back, it came well below her knees and shone in the light as if it
   possessed some separate, unholy vitality of its own. I would almost
   have thought of Medusa or Berenice myself without having such things
   suggested to me, upon seeing and studying that hair.

   "Sometimes I thought it moved slightly of itself, and tended to arrange
   itself in distinct ropes or strands, but this may have been sheer
   illusion. She brushed it incessantly, and seemed to use some sort of
   preparation on it. I got the notion once, a curious, whimsical notion,
   that it was a living thing which she had to feed in some strange way.
   All nonsense—but it added to my feeling of constraint about her and her
   hair.

   "For I can't deny that I failed to like her wholly, no matter how hard
   I tried. Something about her repelled me subtly, and I could not help
   weaving morbid and macabre associations about everything connected with
   her. Her complexion called up thoughts of Babylon, Atlantis, Lemuria,
   and the terrible forgotten dominations of an elder world; her eyes
   struck me sometimes as the eyes of some unholy forest creature or
   animal-goddess too immeasurably ancient to be fully human; and her
   hair—that dense, exotic, overnourished growth of oily jet—made one
   shiver as a great black python might have done. There was no doubt but
   that she realized my involuntary attitude, though I tried to hide it,
   and she tried to hide the fact that she noticed it.

   "Yet the boy's infatuation lasted. He positively fawned on her, and
   overdid all the little gallantries of daily life to a sickening degree.
   She appeared to return the feeling, though I could see it took a
   conscious effort to make her duplicate his enthusiasms and
   extravagances. For one thing, I think she was piqued to learn that we
   weren't as wealthy as she had expected.

   "It was a bad business all told. I could see that sad undercurrents
   were arising. Denis was half hypnotized with puppy-love, and began to
   grow away from me as he felt my shrinking from his wife. This kind of
   thing went on for months, and I saw that I was losing my only son, the
   boy who had formed the center of all my thoughts and acts for the past
   quarter of a century.

   "Marceline seemed to be a good wife enough in those early months, and
   our friends received her without any quibbling or questioning. I was
   always nervous, though, about what some of the young fellows in Paris
   might write home to their relatives after the news of the marriage
   spread around. Despite the woman's love of secrecy, it couldn't remain
   hidden forever; indeed Denis had written a few of his closest friends,
   in strict confidence, as soon as he was settled with her at Riverside.

   "I got to staying more and more alone in my room with my failing health
   as an excuse. It was about that time that my present spinal neuritis
   began to develop. Denis didn't seem to notice the trouble, or take any
   interest in me and my habits and affairs; and it hurt me to see how
   callous he was getting. I began to get sleepless, and often racked my
   brain in the night to try to find out what really was the matter—what
   it really was that made my new daughter-in-law so repulsive and even
   dimly horrible to me.

   "Oddly, the only ones who seemed to share my uneasiness were the
   servants. The darkies around the house seemed very sullen in their
   attitude toward her, and in a few weeks all save the few who were
   strongly attached to our family had left. These few—old Scipio and his
   wife Sarah, the cook Delilah, and Mary, Scipio's daughter, were as
   civil as possible, but plainly revealed that their new mistress
   commanded their duty rather than their affection. They stayed in their
   own remote part of the house as much as possible. McCabe, our white
   chauffeur, was insolently admiring rather than hostile; and another
   exception was a very old Zulu woman, said to have come from Africa over
   a hundred years before, who had been a sort of leader in her small
   cabin as a kind of family pensioner. Old Sophonisba always showed
   reverence whenever Marceline came near her, and one time I saw her kiss
   the ground where her mistress had walked. Blacks are superstitious
   animals, and I wondered whether Marceline had been talking any of her
   mystical nonsense to our hands in order to overcome their evident
   dislike.

   "Well, that's how we went on for nearly half a year. Then, in the
   summer of 1916, things began to happen. Toward the middle of June Denis
   got a note from his old friend Frank Marsh, telling of a sort of
   nervous breakdown which made him want to take a rest in the country. It
   was post-marked New Orleans, for Marsh had gone home from Paris when he
   felt the collapse coming on, and seemed a very plain though polite bid
   for an invitation from us. Marsh, of course, knew that Marceline was
   here, and asked very courteously after her. Denis was sorry to hear of
   his trouble and told him at once to come along for an indefinite visit.
     __________________________________________________________________

   "Marsh came, and I was shocked to notice how he had changed since I had
   seen him in his earlier days. He was a smallish, lightish fellow, with
   blue eyes and an undecided chin; and now I could see the effects of
   drink and I don't know what else in his puffy eye-lids, enlarged
   nose-pores, and heavy lines around the mouth. I reckon he had taken his
   pose of decadence pretty seriously, and set out to be as much of a
   Rimbaud, Baudelaire, or Lautremont as he could. And yet he was
   delightful to talk to, for like all decadents he was exquisitely
   sensitive to the color and atmosphere and names of things; admirably,
   thoroughly alive, and with whole records of conscious experience in
   obscure, shadowy fields of living and feeling which most of us pass
   over without knowing they exist.

   "I was glad of the visit, for I felt it would help to set up a normal
   atmosphere in the house again. And that's what it really seemed to do
   at first; for, as I said, Marsh was a delight to have around. He was as
   sincere and profound an artist as I ever saw in my life, and I
   certainly believe that nothing on earth mattered to him except the
   perception and expression of beauty. When he saw an exquisite thing, or
   was creating one, his eyes would dilate until the light irises went
   nearly out of sight, leaving two mystical black pits in that weak,
   delicate, chalk-like face; black pits opening on strange worlds which
   none of us could guess about.

   "When he reached here, though, he didn't have any chances to show this
   tendency; for he had (as he told Denis) gone quite stale. It seems he
   had been very successful as an artist of a bizarre kind—like Fuseli or
   Goya or Sime or Clark Ashton Smith—but had suddenly become played out.
   The world of ordinary things around him had ceased to hold anything he
   could recognize as beauty of enough force and poignancy to arouse his
   creative faculty. He had often been this way before, but this time he
   could not invent any new, strange, or outré sensation or experience
   which would supply the needed illusion of fresh beauty or stimulating
   adventurous expectancy. He was like a Durtal or a des Esseintes at the
   most jaded point of his curious orbit.

   "Marceline was away when Marsh arrived. She hadn't been enthusiastic
   about his coming, and had refused to decline an invitation from some of
   our friends in St. Louis which came about that time for her and Denis.
   Denis, of course, stayed to receive his guest, but Marceline had gone
   on alone. It was the first time they had ever been separated, and I
   hoped the interval would help dispel the sort of daze that was making
   such a fool of the boy. Marceline showed no hurry to get back, but
   seemed to me to prolong her absence as much as she could. Denis stood
   it better than one would have expected from such a doting husband, and
   seemed more like his old self as he talked over other days with Marsh
   and tried to cheer the listless esthete up.

   "It was Marsh who seemed most impatient to see the woman; perhaps
   because he thought her strange beauty, or some phase of the mysticism
   which had gone into her one-time magical cult, might help to reawaken
   his interest in things and give him another start toward artistic
   creation. That there was no baser reason, I was absolutely certain from
   what I knew of Marsh's character. With all his weaknesses, he was a
   gentleman, and it had indeed relieved me when I first learned that he
   wanted to come here because his willingness to accept Denis'
   hospitality proved that there was no reason why he shouldn't.

   "When, at last, Marceline did return, I could see that Marsh was
   tremendously affected. He did not attempt to make her talk of the
   bizarre thing which she had so definitely abandoned, but was unable to
   hide a powerful admiration which kept his eyes—now dilated in that
   curious way for the first time during his visit—riveted to her every
   moment she was in the room. She, however, seemed uneasy rather than
   pleased by his steady scrutiny; that is, she seemed so at first, though
   this feeling of hers wore away in a few days, and left the two on a
   basis of the most cordial and voluble congeniality. I could see Marsh
   studying her constantly when he thought no one was watching, and I
   wondered how long it would be that only the artist, and not the
   primitive man, would be aroused by her mysterious graces.

   "Denis naturally felt some irritation at this turn of affairs; though
   he realized that his guest was a man of honor and that, as kindred
   mystics and esthetes, Marceline and Marsh would naturally have things
   and interests to discuss in which a more or less conventional person
   could have no part. He didn't hold anything against anybody, but merely
   regretted that his own imagination was too limited and traditional to
   let him talk with Marceline as Marsh talked. At this stage of things I
   began to see more of the boy. With his wife otherwise busy, he had time
   to remember that he had a father, who was ready to help him in any
   difficulty.

   "We often sat together on the veranda watching Marsh and Marceline as
   they rode up or down the drive on horseback, or played tennis on the
   court that used to stretch south of the house. They talked mostly in
   French, which Marsh, though he hadn't more than a quarter-portion of
   French blood, handled more glibly than either Denis or I could speak
   it. Marceline's English, always academically correct, was rapidly
   improving in accent; but it was plain that she relished dropping back
   into her mother-tongue. As we looked at the congenial couple they made,
   I could see the boy's cheek and throat muscles tighten; though he
   wasn't a whit less ideal a host to Marsh, or a whit less considerate a
   husband to Marceline.

   "All this was generally in the afternoon; for Marceline rose very late,
   had breakfast in bed, and took an immense amount of time preparing to
   come downstairs. It was in these morning hours that Denis and Marsh did
   their real visiting, and exchanged the close confidences which kept
   their friendship up despite the strain that jealousy imposed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   "Well, it was in one of those morning talks on the veranda that Marsh
   made the proposition which brought on the end. I was laid up, but had
   managed to get downstairs and stretch out on the front parlor sofa near
   the long window. Denis and Marsh were just outside; so I couldn't help
   hearing all they said. They had been talking about art, and the
   curious, capricious environmental elements needed to jolt an artist
   into producing work of merit, when Marsh suddenly swerved from
   abstractions to the personal application he must have had in mind from
   the start.

   "'I suppose,' he was saying, 'that nobody can tell just what it is in
   some scenes or objects that makes them esthetic stimuli for certain
   individuals. Basically, of course, it must have some reference to each
   man's background of stored-up mental associations; for no two people
   have the same scale of sensitiveness and responses. For some of us all
   ordinary things have ceased to have any emotional or imaginative
   significance, but no one responds in the same way to exactly the same
   extraordinary thing. Now take me, for instance....

   "'I know, Denny, that I can say these things to you because you have
   such a preternaturally unspoiled mind—clean, objective, and all that.
   You won't misunderstand. The fact is, I think I know what's needed to
   set my imagination working again. I've had a dim idea of it ever since
   we were in Paris, but I'm sure now. It's Marceline, old chap; that face
   and that hair, and the train of shadowy images they bring up. Not
   merely visible beauty—though God knows there's enough of that—but
   something peculiar and individualized, that can't exactly be explained.
   Do you know, in the last few days I've felt the existence of such a
   stimulus so keenly that I honestly think I could outdo myself, if I
   could get hold of paint and canvas at just the time when her face and
   hair set my fancy stirring and weaving.

   "'There is something weird and other-worldly about it, something joined
   up with the dim ancient thing Marceline represents. I don't know how
   much she's told you about that side of her, but I can assure you
   there's plenty to it. She has some marvelous links with the outside.'

   "Some change in Denis' expression must have halted the speaker here,
   for there was a considerable spell of silence before the words went on.
   I was utterly taken aback, for I'd expected no such overt development
   as this, and I wondered what my son could be thinking. My heart began
   to pound violently, and I strained my ears in the frankest of
   intentional eavesdropping. Then Marsh resumed.

   "'Of course you're jealous—I know how a speech like mine must sound—but
   I can swear to you that you needn't be.'

   "Denis did not answer, and Marsh went on.

   "'To tell the truth, I could never be in love with Marceline—I couldn't
   even be a cordial friend of hers in the warmest sense. Why, damn it
   all, I feel like a hypocrite talking with her these days as I've been
   doing.

   "'The case simply is, that one phase of her half hypnotizes me in a
   certain way—a very strange, fantastic, and dimly terrible way—just as
   another phase half hypnotizes you in a much more normal way. I see
   something in her—or to be psychologically exact, something through her
   or beyond her—that you don't see at all; something that brings up a
   vast pageantry of shapes from forgotten abysses, and makes me want to
   paint incredible things whose outlines vanish the instant I try to
   envisage them clearly. Don't mistake, Denny: your wife is a magnificent
   being, a splendid focus of cosmic forces who has a right to be called
   divine if anything on earth has!'

   "I felt a clearing of the situation at this point, for the abstract
   strangeness of Marsh's expressed sentiment, plus the flattery he was
   now heaping on Marceline, could not fail to disarm and mollify one as
   fondly proud of his consort as Denis always was. Marsh evidently caught
   the change himself, for there was more confidence in his tone as he
   continued.

   "'I must paint her, Denny, must paint that hair, and you won't regret
   it. There's something more than mortal about that hair, something more
   than beautiful——'

   "He paused, and I wondered what Denis could be thinking. Was Marsh's
   interest actually that of the artist alone, or was he merely infatuated
   as Denis had been? I had thought, in their school days, that he had
   envied my boy, and I dimly felt that it might be the same now. On the
   other hand, something in that talk of artistic stimulus had rung
   amazingly true; so that the more I pondered, the more I was inclined to
   take the stuff at face value. Denis seemed to do so, too, for although
   I could not catch his low-spoken reply, I could tell by the effect it
   produced that it must have been affirmative.

   "There was a sound of someone slapping another on the back, and then a
   grateful speech from Marsh that I was long to remember.

   "'That's great, Denny; and just as I told you, you'll never regret it.
   In a sense, I'm half doing it for you. You'll be a different man when
   you see it. It'll put you back where you used to be—give you a
   waking-up and a sort of salvation—but you can't see what I mean as yet.
   Just remember old friendship, and don't get the idea that I'm not the
   same old bird!'
     __________________________________________________________________

   "I rose perplexedly as I saw the two stroll off across the lawn, arm in
   arm. What could Marsh have meant by his strange and almost ominous
   reassurance? The more my fears were quieted in one direction, the more
   they were aroused in another. Look at it in any way I could, it seemed
   to be rather a bad business.

   "But matters got started just the same. Denis fixed up an attic room
   with skylights, and Marsh sent for all sorts of painting equipment.
   Everyone was rather excited about the new venture, and I was at least
   glad that something was on foot to break the brooding tension.

   "Soon the sittings began, and we all took them quite seriously, for we
   could see that Marsh regarded them as important artistic events. Denny
   and I used to go quietly about the house as though something sacred
   were occurring.

   "With Marceline, though, it was a different matter, as I began to see
   at once. Whatever Marsh's reactions to the sittings may have been, hers
   were painfully obvious. Every possible way she betrayed a frank and
   commonplace infatuation for the artist, and would repulse Denis' marks
   of affection whenever she dared. Oddly, I noticed this more vividly
   than Denis himself, and tried to devise some plan for keeping the boy's
   mind easy until the matter could be straightened out. There was no use
   in having him excited about it if it could be helped.

   "In the end I decided that Denis had better be away while the
   disagreeable situation existed. I could represent his interests well
   enough at this end, and sooner or later Marsh would finish the picture
   and go. My view of Marsh's honor was such that I did not look for any
   worse developments. When the matter had blown over, and Marceline had
   forgotten about her new infatuation, it would be time enough to have
   Denis on hand again.

   "So I wrote a long letter to my marketing and financial agent in New
   York, and cooked up a plan to have the boy summoned there for an
   indefinite time. I had the agent write him that our affairs absolutely
   required one of us to go East, and of course my illness made it clear
   that I could not be the one. It was arranged that when Denis got to New
   York he would find enough plausible matters to keep him busy as long as
   I thought he ought to be away.

   "The plan worked perfectly, and Denis started for New York without the
   least suspicion. Marceline and Marsh went with him in the car to Cape
   Girardeau, where he caught the afternoon train to St. Louis. They
   returned about dark, and as McCabe drove the car back to the stables I
   could hear them talking on the veranda. This time I resolved to do some
   intentional eavesdropping, so quietly went down to the front parlor and
   stretched out on the sofa near the window.

   "At first I could hear nothing, but very shortly there came a sound as
   of a chair being shifted, followed by a short, sharp breath and a sort
   of inarticulately hurt exclamation from Marceline. Then I heard Marsh
   speaking in a strained, almost formal voice.

   "'I'd enjoy working tonight—if you're not too tired.'

   "Marceline's reply was in the same hurt tone which had marked her
   exclamation. She used English, as he had done.

   "'Oh, Frank, is that really all you care about? Forever working! Can't
   we just sit out in this glorious moonlight?'

   "He answered impatiently, his voice showing a certain contempt beneath
   the dominant quality of artistic enthusiasm.

   "'Moonlight! Good God, what cheap sentimentality! For a supposedly
   sophisticated person you surely do hang on to some of the crudest
   claptrap that ever escaped from the dime novels. With art at your
   elbow, you have to think of the moon! Or perhaps it makes you think of
   the Roodmus dance around the stone pillars at Auteuil; hell! how you
   used to make those goggle-eyed yaps stare! But no, I suppose you've
   dropped all that now. No more Atlantean magic or hair-snake rites for
   Madame de Russy! I'm the only one to remember the old things, the
   things that came down through the temples of Tanit and called on the
   ramparts of Zimbabwe. But I won't be cheated of that remembrance—all
   that is weaving itself into the thing on my canvas—the thing that is
   going to capture wonder and crystallize the secrets of seventy-five
   thousand years.'

   "Marceline interrupted in a voice full of mixed emotions.

   "'It's you who are cheaply sentimental now! You know well that the old
   things had better be let alone. All of you had better look out if ever
   I chant the old rites or try to call up what lies hidden in Yuggoth,
   Zimbabwe, and Rl'yeh. I thought you had more sense!

   "'You lack logic. You want me to be interested in this precious
   painting of yours, yet you never let me see what you're doing. Always
   that black cloth over it! It's of me—I shouldn't think it would matter
   if I saw it.'

   "Marsh was interrupting this time, his voice curiously hard and
   strained.

   "'No. Not now. You'll see it in due time. You say it's of you—yes, it's
   that, but it's more. If you knew, you mightn't be so impatient. Poor
   Denis! My God, it's a shame!'

   "My throat went suddenly dry as the words rose to an almost febrile
   pitch. What could Marsh mean? Suddenly I saw that he had stopped and
   was entering the house alone. I heard the front door slam, and listened
   as his footsteps ascended the stairs. Outside on the veranda I could
   still hear Marceline's heavy, angry breathing. I crept away sick at
   heart, feeling that there were grave things to ferret out before I
   could safely let Denis come back.
     __________________________________________________________________

   "After that evening the tension around the place was even worse than
   before. Marceline had always lived on flattery and fawning, and the
   shock of those few blunt words from Marsh was too much for her
   temperament.

   "There was no living in the house with her any more, for with poor
   Denis gone she took out her abusiveness on everybody. When she could
   find no one indoors to quarrel with she would go out to Sophonisba's
   cabin and spend hours talking with the queer old Zulu woman. Aunt Sophy
   was the only person who would fawn abjectly enough to suit her, and
   when I tried once to overhear their conversation I found Marceline
   whispering about elder secrets and unknown Kadath while the Negress
   rocked to and fro in her chair, making inarticulate sounds of reverence
   and admiration every now and then.

   "But nothing could break her dog-like infatuation for Marsh. She would
   talk bitterly and sullenly to him, yet was getting more and more
   obedient to his wishes. It was very convenient for him, since he now
   became able to make her pose for the picture whenever he felt like
   painting. He tried to show gratitude for this willingness, but I
   thought I could detect a kind of contempt or even loathing beneath his
   careful politeness. For my part, I frankly hated Marceline! There was
   no use in calling my attitude anything as mild as mere dislike these
   days. Certainly, I was glad Denis was away. His letters, not nearly so
   frequent as I wished, showed signs of strain and worry.

   "As the middle of August went by I gathered from Marsh's remarks that
   the portrait was nearly done. His mood seemed increasingly sardonic,
   though Marceline's temper improved a bit, as the prospect of seeing the
   thing tickled her vanity. I can still recall the day when Marsh said
   he'd have everything finished within a week. Marceline brightened up
   perceptibly, though not without a venomous look at me. It seemed as if
   her coiled hair visibly tightened about her head.

   "'I'm to be the first to see it!' she snapped. Then, smiling at Marsh,
   she added, 'And if I don't like it I shall slash it to pieces!'

   "Marsh's face took on the most curious look I had ever seen it wear as
   he answered her.

   "'I can't vouch for your taste, Marceline, but I swear it will be
   magnificent! Not that I want to take much credit—art creates itself—and
   this thing had to be done. Just wait!'

   "During the next few days I felt a queer sense of foreboding, as if the
   completion of the picture meant a kind of catastrophe instead of a
   relief. Denis, too, had not written me, and my agent in New York said
   he was planning some trip to the country. I wondered what the outcome
   of the whole thing would be. What a queer mixture of elements—Marsh and
   Marceline, Denis and I! How would all these ultimately react on one
   another? When my fears grew too great I tried to lay them all to my
   infirmity, but that explanation never quite satisfied me.
     __________________________________________________________________

   "Well, the thing exploded on Tuesday, the 26th of August. I had risen
   at my usual time and had breakfast, but was not good for much because
   of the pain in my spine. It had been troubling me badly of late, and
   forcing me to take opiates when it got too unbearable; nobody else was
   downstairs except the servants, though I could hear Marceline moving
   about in her room. Marsh slept in the attic next his studio, and had
   begun to keep such late hours that he was seldom up till noon. About
   ten o'clock the pain got the better of me, so that I took a double dose
   of my opiate and lay down on the parlor sofa. The last I heard was
   Marceline's pacing overhead. Poor creature—if I had known! She must
   have been walking before the long mirror admiring herself. That was
   like her—vain from start to finish, reveling in her own beauty, just as
   she reveled in all the little luxuries Denis was able to give her.

   "I didn't wake up till near sunset, and knew instantly how long I had
   slept from the golden light and long shadows outside the window. Nobody
   was about, and a sort of unnatural stillness seemed to be hovering over
   everything. From afar, though, I thought I could sense a faint howling,
   wild and intermittent, whose quality had a slight but baffling
   familiarity about it. I'm not much for psychic premonitions, but I was
   frightfully uneasy from the start. There had been dreams, even worse
   than the ones I had been dreaming in the weeks before; and this time
   they seemed hideously linked to some black and festering reality. The
   whole place had a poisonous air. Afterward I reflected that certain
   sounds must have filtered through to my unconscious brain during those
   hours of drugged sleep. My pain, though, was very much eased, and I
   rose and walked without difficulty.

   "Soon enough I began to see that something was wrong. Marsh and
   Marceline might have been riding, but someone ought to have been
   getting dinner in the kitchen. Instead there was only silence, except
   for that faint distant howl or wail, and nobody answered when I pulled
   the old-fashioned bell-cord to summon Scipio. Then, chancing to look
   up, I saw the spreading stain on the ceiling—the bright red stain, that
   must have come through the floor of Marceline's room.

   "In an instant I forgot my crippled back and hurried upstairs to find
   out the worst. Everything under the sun raced through my mind as I
   struggled with the dampness-warped door of that silent chamber, and
   most hideous of all was a terrible sense of malign fulfilment and fatal
   expectedness. I had, it struck me, known all along that nameless
   horrors were gathering; that something profoundly evil had gained a
   foothold under my roof from which only blood and tragedy could result.

   "The door gave at last, and I stumbled into the large room beyond—all
   dim from the branches of the great trees outside the windows. For a
   moment I could do nothing but flinch at the faint evil odor that
   immediately struck my nostrils. Then, turning on the electric light and
   glancing around, I glimpsed a nameless blasphemy on the yellow and blue
   rug.

   "It lay face down in a great pool of dark, thickened blood, and had the
   gory print of a shod human foot in the middle of its naked back. Blood
   was spattered everywhere—on the walls, furniture and floor. My knees
   gave way as I took in the sight, so that I had to stumble to a chair
   and slump down. The thing had obviously been a human being, though its
   identity was not easy to establish at first, since it was without
   clothes and had most of its hair hacked and torn from the scalp in a
   very crude way. It was of a deep ivory color, and I knew that it must
   have been Marceline. The shoeprint on the back made the thing seem all
   the more hellish. I could not even picture the strange, loathsome
   tragedy which must have taken place while I slept in the room below.
   When I raised my hand to wipe my dripping forehead I saw that my
   fingers were sticky with blood. I shuddered, then realized that it must
   have come from the knob of the door which the unknown murderer had
   forced shut behind him as he left. He had taken his weapon with him, it
   seemed, for no instrument of death was visible here.

   "As I studied the floor I saw that a line of sticky footprints like the
   one on the body led away from the horror to the door. There was another
   blood-trail, too, and of a less easily explainable kind; a broadish,
   continuous line, as if marking the path of some huge snake. At first I
   concluded it must be due to something the murderer had dragged after
   him. Then, noting the way some of the footprints seemed to be
   superimposed on it, I was forced to believe that it had been there when
   the murderer left. But what crawling entity could have been in that
   room with the victim and her assassin, leaving before the killer when
   the deed was done? As I asked myself this question, I thought I heard
   fresh bursts of that faint, distant wailing.

   "Finally, rousing myself from a lethargy of horror, I got on my feet
   again and began following the footprints. Who the murderer was, I could
   not even faintly guess, nor could I try to explain the absence of the
   servants. I vaguely felt that I ought to go up to Marsh's attic
   quarters, but before I had fully formulated the idea I saw that the
   bloody trail was indeed taking me there. Was he himself the murderer?
   Had he gone mad under the strain of the morbid situation and suddenly
   run amok?

   "In the attic corridor the trail became faint, the prints almost
   ceasing as they merged with the dark carpet. I could still, however,
   discern the strange single path of the entity which had gone first, and
   this led straight to the closed door of Marsh's studio, disappearing
   beneath it at a point about halfway from side to side. Evidently it had
   crossed the threshold at a time when the door was wide open.
     __________________________________________________________________

   "Sick at heart, I tried the knob and found the door unlocked. Opening
   it, I paused in the waning north light to see what fresh nightmare
   might be waiting me. There was certainly something human on the floor,
   and I reached for the switch to turn on the chandelier.

   "But as the light flashed up, my gaze left the floor and its
   horror—that was Marsh, poor devil!—to fix itself frantically and
   incredulously upon the living thing that cowered and stared in the open
   doorway leading to Marsh's bedroom. It was a tousled, wild-eyed thing,
   crusted with the dried blood and carrying in its hand a wicked machete
   which had been one of the ornaments of the studio wall. Yet even in
   that awful moment I recognized it as one whom I had thought more than a
   thousand miles away. It was my own boy Denis—or the maddened wreck
   which had once been Denis.

   "The sight of me seemed to bring back a trifle of sanity—or at least of
   memory—in the poor boy. He straightened up and began to toss his head
   about as if trying to shake free from some enveloping influence. I
   could not speak a word, but moved my lips in an effort to get back my
   voice. My eyes wandered for a moment to the figure on the floor in
   front of the heavily draped easel—the figure toward which the strange
   blood-trail led, and which seemed to be tangled in the coils of some
   dark, ropy object. The shifting of my glance apparently produced some
   impression in the twisted brain of the boy, for suddenly he began to
   mutter in a hoarse whisper, the purport of which I was soon able to
   catch.

   "'I had to exterminate her—she was the devil!—the summit of
   high-priestess of all evil—the spawn of the pit—Marsh knew, and tried
   to warn me. Good old Frank! I didn't kill him, though I was ready to
   before I realized. But I went down there and killed her—then that
   cursed hair——'

   "I listened in horror as Denis choked, paused, and began again.

   "'You didn't know—her letters got queer and I knew she was with Marsh.
   Then she nearly stopped writing. He never mentioned her—I felt
   something was wrong, and thought I ought to come back and find out.
   Couldn't tell you—your manner would have given it away. Wanted to
   surprise them. Got here about noon today—came in a cab and sent the
   house-servants all off—let the field hands alone, for their cabins are
   all out of earshot. Told McCabe to get me some things in Cape Girardeau
   and not bother to come back till tomorrow. Had all the niggers take the
   old car and let Mary drive them to Bend Village for a vacation—told 'em
   we were all going on some sort of outing and wouldn't need help. Said
   they'd better stay all night with Uncle Scip's cousin, who keeps that
   nigger boarding-house.'

   "Denis was getting very coherent now, and I strained my ears to grasp
   every word. Again I thought I heard that wild, far-off wail, but the
   story had first place for the present.

   "'Saw you sleeping in the parlor, and took a chance you wouldn't wake
   up. Then went upstairs on the quiet to hunt up Marsh and—that woman!'

   "The boy shuddered as he avoided pronouncing Marceline's name. At the
   same time I saw his eyes dilate in unison with a bursting of the
   distant crying, whose vague familiarity had now become very great.

   "'She was not in her room, so I went up to the studio. Door was shut,
   and I could hear voices inside. Didn't knock—just burst in and found
   her posing for the picture. Nude, but with that hellish hair all draped
   around her. And making all sorts of sheep's-eyes at Marsh. He had the
   easel turned half away from the door, so I couldn't see the picture.
   Both of them were pretty well jolted when I showed up, and Marsh
   dropped his brush. I was in a rage and told him he'd have to show me
   the portrait, but he got calmer every minute—told me it wasn't quite
   done, but would be in a day or two—said I could see it then—she hadn't
   seen it.

   "'But that didn't go with me. I stepped up, and he dropped a velvet
   curtain over the thing before I could see it. He was ready to fight
   before letting me see it, but that—that—she—stepped up and sided with
   me. Said we ought to see it. Frank got horribly worked up, and gave me
   a punch when I tried to get at the curtain. I punched back and seemed
   to have knocked him out. Then I was almost knocked out myself by the
   shriek that—that creature—gave. She'd drawn aside the hangings herself,
   and had caught a look at what Marsh had been painting. I wheeled around
   and saw her rushing like mad out of the room. Then I saw the picture.'
     __________________________________________________________________

   "Madness flared up in the boy's eyes again as he got to this place, and
   I thought for a minute he was going to spring at me with his machete.
   But after a pause he partly steadied himself.

   "'O God—that thing! Don't ever look at it! Burn it with the hangings
   around it and throw the ashes into the river! Marsh knew—and was
   warning me. He knew what it was—what that woman—that leopardess, or
   gorgon, or lamia, or whatever she was—actually represented. He'd tried
   to hint to me ever since I met her in his Paris studio, but it couldn't
   be told in words. I thought they all wronged her when they whispered
   horrors about her, but this picture has caught the whole secret—the
   whole monstrous background!

   "'God, but Frank is an artist! That thing is the greatest piece of work
   any living soul has produced since Rembrandt! It's a crime to burn it,
   but it would be a greater crime to let it exist—just as it would have
   been an abhorrent sin to let that she-demon exist any longer. The
   minute I saw it I understood what she was, and what part she played in
   the frightful secret that has come down from the days of Cthulhu and
   the Elder Ones—the secret that was nearly wiped out when Atlantis sunk,
   but that kept half alive in hidden traditions and allegorical myths and
   furtive, midnight cult-practises. She was the real thing. It wasn't any
   fake. It would have been merciful if it had been a fake. It was the
   old, hideous shadow that philosophers never dared mention—the thing
   hinted of in the Necronomicon and symbolized in the Easter Island
   colossi.

   "'She thought we couldn't see through—that the false front would hold
   till we had bartered away our immortal souls. And she was half
   right—she'd have got me in the end. She was only—waiting. But
   Frank—good old Frank—was too much for her. He knew what it all meant,
   and painted it. I don't wonder she shrieked and ran off when she saw
   it. It wasn't quite done, but God knows enough was there.

   "'Then I knew I'd got to kill her—kill her, and everything connected
   with her. It was a taint that wholesome human blood couldn't bear.
   There was something else, too—but you'll never know that if you burn
   the picture without looking. I staggered down to her room with this
   machete that I got off the wall here, leaving Frank still knocked out.
   He was breathing, though, and I knew and thanked heaven that I hadn't
   killed him.

   "'I found her in front of the mirror braiding that accursed hair. She
   turned on me like a wild beast, and began spitting out her hatred of
   Marsh. The fact that she'd been in love with him (and I knew she had)
   only made it worse. For a minute I couldn't move, and she came within
   an ace of completely hypnotizing me. Then I thought of the picture, and
   the spell broke. She saw the breaking in my eyes, and must have noticed
   the machete too. I never saw anything but a wild jungle beast look as
   she did then. She sprang for me with claws out like a leopard's, but I
   was too quick. I swung the machete, and it was all over.'

   "Denis had to stop again there, and I saw the perspiration running down
   his forehead through the spattered blood. But in a moment he hoarsely
   resumed.

   "'I said it was all over—but God! some of it had only just begun! I
   felt I had fought the legions of Satan, and put my foot on the back of
   the thing I had annihilated. Then I saw that blasphemous braid of
   coarse black hair began to twist and squirm of itself.

   "'I might have known it. It was all in the old tales. That damnable
   hair had a life of its own, that couldn't be ended by killing the
   creature herself. I knew I'd have to burn it, so I started to hack it
   off with the machete. God, but it was devilish work! Tough—like iron
   wires—but I managed to do it. And it was loathsome the way the big
   braid writhed and struggled in my grasp.

   "'About the time I had the last strand cut or pulled off I heard the
   eldritch wailing from behind the house. It's still going, off and on. I
   don't know what it is, but it must be something springing from this
   hellish business. It half seems like something I ought to know but
   can't quite place. It got my nerves the first time I heard it, and I
   dropped the severed braid in my fright. Then I got a worse fright, for
   in another second the braid had turned on me and began to strike
   venomously with one of its ends which had knotted itself up like a sort
   of grotesque head. I struck out with the machete, and it turned away.
   Then, when I had my breath again, I saw that the monstrous thing was
   crawling along the floor by itself like a great black snake. I couldn't
   do anything for a while, but when it vanished through the door I
   managed to pull myself together and stumble after it. I could follow
   the broad, bloody trail, and I saw it led upstairs. It brought me
   here—and may heaven curse me if I didn't see it through the doorway,
   striking at poor dazed Marsh like a maddened rattler as it had struck
   at me, finally coiling around him as a python would. He had begun to
   come to, but that abominable serpent thing got him before he was on his
   feet. I knew that all of that woman's hatred was behind it, but I
   hadn't the power to pull it off. I tried, but it was too much for me.
   Even the machete was no good—I couldn't swing it freely or it would
   have slashed Frank to pieces. So I saw those monstrous coils
   tighten—saw poor Frank crushed to death before my eyes—and all the time
   that awful faint howling came from somewhere beyond the fields.

   "'That's all. I pulled the velvet cloth over the picture, and I hope
   it'll never be lifted. The thing must be burnt. I couldn't pry the
   coils off poor, dead Frank—they clung to him like a leech, and seemed
   to have lost their motion altogether. It's as if that snaky rope of
   hair had a kind of perverse fondness for the man it killed—it's
   clinging to him—embracing him. You'll have to burn poor Frank with
   it—but for God's sake don't forget to see it in ashes! That and the
   picture. They must both go. The safety of the world demands that they
   go!'
     __________________________________________________________________

   "Denis might have whispered more, but a fresh burst of distant wailing
   cut us short. For the first time we knew what it was, for a westerly
   veering wind brought articulate words at last. We ought to have known
   long before, since sounds much like it had often come from the same
   source. It was wrinkled Sophonisba, the ancient Zulu witchwoman who had
   fawned on Marceline, keening from her cabin in a way which crowned the
   horrors of this nightmare tragedy. We could both hear some of the
   things she howled, and knew that secret and primordial bonds linked
   this savage sorceress with that other inheritor of Elder secrets who
   had just been extirpated. Some of the words she used betrayed her
   closeness to demonic and palesgean traditions.

   "'Iä! Iä! Shub-Niggurath! Ya-R'lyeh! N'gagi n'bulu bwana n'lolo! Ya,
   yo, pore Missy Tanit, pore Missy Isis! Marse Clooloo, come up outen de
   water an' git yo' chile—she done daid! She done daid! De har ain' got
   no missus no mo', Marse Clooloo. Ol' Sophy, she know! Ol' Sophy, she
   done got de black stone outen Big Zimbabwe in ol' Affriky! Ol' Sophy,
   she done dance in de moonshine roun' de crocodile-stone befo' de
   N'bangus cotch her and sell her to de ship folks! No mo' Tanit! No mo'
   Isis! No mo' witchwoman to keep de fire a-goin' in de big stone place!
   Ya, yo! N'gagi 'bulu bwana m'lolo! Iä! Shub-Niggurath! She daid! Ol'
   Sophy know!'

   "That wasn't the end of the wailing, but it was all I could pay
   attention to. The expression on my boy's face showed that it had
   reminded him of something frightful, and the tightening of his hand on
   the machete boded no good. I knew he was desperate, and sprang to
   disarm him if possible before he could do anything more.

   "But I was too late. An old man with a bad spine doesn't count for much
   physically. There was a struggle, but he had done for himself before
   many seconds were over. I'm not sure yet but that he tried to kill me,
   too. His last panting words were something about the need of wiping out
   everything that had ever been connected with Marceline, either by blood
   or marriage.

   "I wonder to this day that I didn't go stark mad in that instant, or in
   the moments and hours afterward. In front of me was the slain body of
   my boy, the only human being I had to cherish, and ten feet away, in
   front of that shrouded easel, was the body of his best friend, with a
   nameless coil of horror wound around it. Below was the scalped corpse
   of that she-monster, about whom I was half ready to believe anything. I
   was too dazed to analyze the probability of the hair story, and even if
   I had not been, that dismal howling from Aunt Sophy's cabin would have
   been enough to quiet doubt.

   "If I'd been wise, I'd have done just what poor Denis told me to—burned
   the picture and the body-grasping hair at once and without
   curiosity—but I was too shaken to be wise. I suppose I muttered foolish
   things over my boy—and then I remembered that the night was wearing on
   and that the servants would be back in the morning. It was plain that a
   matter like this could never be explained, and I knew that I must cover
   things up and invent a story.

   "That coil of hair around Marsh was a monstrous thing. I didn't dare
   touch it, and the longer I looked at it the more horrible things I
   noticed about it. One thing gave me a start. I won't mention it, but it
   partly explained the need for feeding the hair with queer oils as
   Marceline had always done.

   "In the end I decided to bury all three bodies in the cellar, with
   quicklime, which I knew we had in the storehouse. It was a night of
   hellish work. I dug three graves—my boy's a long way from the other
   two, for I didn't want him to be near either the woman's body or her
   hair. I was sorry I couldn't get the coil from around poor Marsh. It
   was terrible work getting them all down to the cellar. I used blankets
   in carting the woman and the poor devil with the coil around him. Then
   I had to get two barrels of lime from the storehouse. God must have
   given me strength, for I not only moved them both but filled all three
   graves without a hitch.

   "Some of the lime I made into white-wash. I had to take a stepladder
   and fix over the parlor ceiling where the blood had oozed through. And
   I burned nearly everything in Marceline's room, scrubbing the walls and
   floor and heavy furniture. I washed up the attic studio, too, and the
   trail and footprints that led there. And all the time I could hear old
   Sophy's wailing in the distance. The devil must have been in that
   creature to let her voice go on like that. But she always was howling
   queer things. That's why the field niggers didn't get scared or curious
   that night. I locked the studio door and took the key to my room. Then
   I burned all my stained clothes in the fire-place. By dawn the whole
   house looked quite normal, so far as any casual eye could tell. I
   hadn't dared touch the covered easel, but meant to attend to that
   later.
     __________________________________________________________________

   "Well, the servants came back next day, and I told them all the young
   folks had gone to St. Louis. None of the field hands seemed to have
   seen or heard anything, and old Sophonisba's wailing had stopped at the
   instant of sunrise. She was like a sphinx after that, and never let out
   a word of what had been on her brooding witch-brain the day and night
   before.

   "Later on I pretended that Denis and Marsh and Marceline had gone back
   to Paris and had a certain discreet agency mail me letters from
   there—letters I had fixed up in forged handwriting. I had the deaths of
   Marsh and Denis reported during the war, and later said Marceline had
   entered a convent. Fortunately Marsh was an orphan whose eccentric ways
   had alienated him from his people in Louisiana. Things might have been
   patched up a good deal better for me if I had had the sense to burn the
   picture, sell the plantation, and give up trying to manage things with
   a shaken and overstrained mind. You see what my folly has brought me
   to. Failing crops, hands discharged one by one, place falling to ruin,
   and myself a hermit and a target for dozens of queer countryside
   stories. Nobody will come around here after dark nowadays—or any other
   time if it can be helped. That's why I knew you must be a stranger.

   "And why do I stay here? I can't wholly tell you that. It's bound up
   too closely with things at the very rim of sane reality. It wouldn't
   have been so, perhaps, if I hadn't looked at the picture. I ought to
   have done as poor Denis told me. I honestly meant to burn it when I
   went up to that locked studio a week after the horror, but I looked
   first—and that changed everything.

   "No—there's no use telling what I saw. You can, in a way, see for
   yourself presently; though time and dampness have done their work. I
   don't think it can hurt you if you want to take a look, but it was
   different with me. I knew too much of what it all meant.

   "Denis had been right—it was the greatest triumph of human art since
   Rembrandt, even though still unfinished. I grasped that at the start,
   and knew that poor Marsh had justified his decadent philosophy. He was
   to painting what Baudelaire was to poetry, and Marceline was the key
   that had unlocked his inmost genius.

   "The thing almost stunned me when I pulled aside the hangings—stunned
   me before I half knew what the whole thing was. You know, it's only
   partly a portrait. Marsh had been pretty literal when he hinted that he
   wasn't painting Marceline alone, but what he saw through her and beyond
   her.

   "Of course she was in it—was the key to it, in a sense—but her figure
   only formed one point in a vast composition. She was nude except for
   that hideous web of hair spun around her, and was half seated, half
   reclining on a sort of bench or divan, carved in patterns unlike those
   of any known decorative tradition. There was a monstrously shaped
   goblet in one hand, from which was spilling fluid whose color I haven't
   been able to place or classify to this day.

   "The figure and the divan were in the left-hand foreground of the
   strangest sort of scene I ever saw in my life. I think there was a
   faint suggestion of its all being a kind of emanation from the woman's
   brain; yet there was also a directly opposite suggestion—as if she were
   just an evil image or hallucination conjured up by the scene itself.

   "I can't tell you now whether it's an exterior or an interior, whether
   those hellish cyclopean vaultings are seen from the outside or the
   inside, or whether they are indeed carven stone and not merely a morbid
   fungous arborescence. The geometry of the whole thing is crazy—one gets
   the acute and obtuse angles all mixed up.

   "And God! The shapes of nightmare that float around in that perpetual
   demon twilight! The blasphemies that lurk and leer and hold a witches'
   sabbat with that woman as a high priestess! The black shaggy entities
   that are not quite goats—the crocodile-headed beast with three legs and
   a dorsal row of tentacles—and the flat-nosed Ægipans dancing in a
   pattern that Egypt's priests knew and called accursed!

   "But the scene wasn't Egypt—it was behind Egypt; behind even Atlantis;
   behind fabled Mu, and myth-whispered Lemuria. It was the ultimate
   fountainhead of all horror on this earth, and the symbolism showed only
   too clearly how integral a part of it Marceline was. I think it must be
   the unmentionable R'lyeh, that was not built by any creatures of our
   planet—the thing Marsh and Denis used to talk about in the shadows with
   hushed voices. In the picture it appears that the whole scene is deep
   under water, though everybody seems to be breathing freely.
     __________________________________________________________________

   "Well, I couldn't do anything but look and shudder, and finally I saw
   that Marceline was watching me craftily out of those monstrous, dilated
   eyes on the canvas. It was no mere superstition—Marsh had actually
   caught something of her horrible vitality in his symphonies of line and
   color; so that she still brooded and stared and hated, just as if most
   of her weren't down in the cellar under quicklime. And it was worst of
   all when some of those Hecate-born snaky strands of hair began to lift
   themselves up from the surface and grope out into the room toward me!

   "Then it was that I knew the last final horror, and realized I was a
   guardian and a prisoner for ever. She was the thing from which the
   first dim legends of Medusa and the Gorgons had sprung, and something
   in my shaken will had been captured and turned to stone at last. Never
   again would I be safe from those coiling snaky strands—the strands in
   the picture, and those that lay brooding under the lime near the wine
   casks. All too late I recalled the tales of the virtual
   indestructibility, even through centuries of burial, of the hair of the
   dead.

   "My life since has been nothing but horror and slavery. Always there
   has lurked the fear of what broods down in the cellar. In less than a
   month the niggers began whispering about the great black snake that
   crawled around near the wine casks after dark, and about the curious
   way its trail would lead to another spot six feet away. Finally I had
   to move everything to another part of the cellar, for not a darky could
   be induced to go near the place where the snake was seen.

   "Then the field hands began talking about the black snake that visited
   old Sophonisba's cabin every night after midnight. One of them showed
   me its trail, and not long afterward I found out that Aunt Sophy
   herself had begun to pay strange visits to the cellar of the big house,
   lingering and muttering for hours in the very spot where none of the
   other blacks would go. God, but I was glad when that old witch died! I
   honestly believe she had been a priestess of some ancient and terrible
   tradition back in Africa. She must have lived to be almost a hundred
   and fifty years old.

   "Sometimes I think I hear something gliding around the house at night.
   There will be a queer noise on the stairs, where the boards are loose,
   and the latch of my room will rattle as if with an inward pressure. I
   always keep my door locked, of course. Then there are certain mornings
   when I seem to catch a sickish musty odor in the corridors, and notice
   a faint, ropy trail through the dust of the floors. I know I must guard
   the hair in the picture, for if anything were to happen to it, there
   are entities in this house which would take a sure and terrible
   revenge. I don't even dare to die; for life and death are all one to
   those in the clutch of what came out of R'lyeh. Something would be on
   hand to punish my neglect. Medusa's coil has got me, and it will always
   be the same. Never mix up with secret and ultimate horror, young man,
   if you value your immortal soul."
     __________________________________________________________________

   As the old man finished his story I saw that the small lamp had long
   since burned dry, and that the large one was nearly empty. It must, I
   knew, be near dawn; and my ears told me that the storm was over. The
   tale had held me in a half-daze, and I almost feared to glance at the
   door lest it reveal an inward pressure from some unnameable source. It
   would be hard to say which had the greatest hold on me—stark horror,
   incredulity, or a kind of morbid fantastic curiosity. I was wholly
   beyond speech and had to wait for my strange host to break the spell.

   "Do you want to see—the thing?"

   His voice was very low and hesitant, and I saw he was tremendously in
   earnest. Of my various emotions, curiosity gained the upper hand, and I
   nodded silently. He rose, lighting a candle on a near-by table and
   holding it high before him as he opened the door.

   "Come with me—upstairs."

   I dreaded to brave those musty corridors again, but fascination downed
   all my qualms. The boards creaked beneath our feet, and I trembled once
   when I thought I saw a faint, rope-like line traced in the dust near
   the staircase.

   The steps of the attic were noisy and rickety, with several of the
   treads missing. I was glad of the need of looking sharply to my
   footing, for it gave me an excuse not to glance about. The attic
   corridor was pitch-black and heavily cobwebbed, and inch-deep with dust
   except where a beaten trail led to a door on the left at the farther
   end. As I noticed the rotting remains of a thick carpet, I thought of
   the other feet which had pressed it in bygone decades—of these, and of
   one thing which did not have feet.

   The old man took me straight to the door at the end of the beaten path,
   and fumbled a second with the rusty latch. I was acutely frightened now
   that I knew the picture was so close, yet dared not retreat at this
   stage. In another moment my host was ushering me into the deserted
   studio.

   The candlelight was very faint, yet served to show most of the
   principal features. I noticed the low, slanting roof, the huge enlarged
   dormer, the curios and trophies hung on the walls, and most of all, the
   great shrouded easel in the center of the floor. To that easel de Russy
   now walked, drawing aside the dusty velvet hangings on the side turned
   away from me, and motioning me silently to approach. It took a good
   deal of courage to make me obey, especially when I saw how my guide's
   eyes dilated in the wavering candlelight as he looked at the unveiled
   canvas. But again curiosity conquered everything, and I walked around
   to where de Russy stood. Then I saw the damnable thing.

   I did not faint, though no reader can possibly realize the effort it
   took to keep me from doing so. I did cry out, but stopped short when I
   saw the frightened look on the old man's face. As I had expected, the
   canvas was warped, moldy, and scabrous from dampness and neglect; but
   for all that I could trace the monstrous hints of evil cosmic
   outsideness that lurked all through the nameless scene's morbid content
   and perverted geometry.

   It was as the old man had said: a vaulted, columned hell of mingled
   Black Masses and witches' sabbats, and what perfect completion could
   have added to it was beyond my power to guess. Decay had only increased
   the utter hideousness of its wicked symbolism and diseased suggestion;
   for the parts most affected by time were just these parts of the
   picture which in nature—or in that extra-cosmic realm that mocked
   nature—would be likely to decay or disintegrate.

   The utmost horror of all, of course, was Marceline; and as I saw the
   bloated, discolored flesh I formed the odd fancy that perhaps the
   figure on the canvas had some obscure, occult linkage with the figure
   which lay in quicklime under the cellar floor. Perhaps the lime had
   preserved the corpse instead of destroying it—but could it have
   preserved those black, malign eyes that glared and mocked at me from
   their painted hell?

   And there was something else about the creature which I could not fail
   to notice—something which de Russy had not been able to put into words,
   but which perhaps had something to do with Denis' wish to kill all
   those of his blood who had dwelt under the same roof with her. Whether
   Marsh knew, or whether the genius in him painted it without his
   knowing, none could say. But Denis and his father could not have known
   till they saw the picture.

   Surpassing all in horror was the streaming black hair, which covered
   the rotting body, but which was itself not even slightly decayed. All I
   had heard of it was amply verified. It was nothing human, this ropy,
   sinuous, half-oily, half-crinkly flood of serpent darkness. Vile,
   independent life proclaimed itself at every unnatural twist and
   convolution, and the suggestion of numberless reptilian heads at the
   out-turned ends was far too marked to be illusory or accidental.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The blasphemous thing held me like a magnet. I was helpless, and did
   not wonder at the myth of the gorgon's glance which turned all
   beholders to stone. Then I thought I saw a change come over the thing.
   The leering features perceptibly moved, so that the rotting jaw fell,
   allowing the thick, beast-like lips to disclose a row of pointed yellow
   fangs. The pupils of the fiendish eyes dilated, and the eyes themselves
   seemed to bulge outward. And the hair—that accursed hair! It had begun
   to rustle and wave perceptibly, the snake-heads all turning toward de
   Russy and vibrating as if to strike!

   Reason deserted me altogether, and before I knew what I was doing I
   drew my revolver and sent a shower of six steel-jacketed bullets
   through the shocking canvas. The whole thing at once fell to pieces,
   even the frame toppling from the easel and clattering to the
   dust-covered floor. But though this horror was shattered, another had
   risen before me in the form of de Russy himself, whose maddened shrieks
   as he saw the picture vanish were almost as terrible as the picture
   itself had been.

   With a half-articulate scream of "God, now you've done it!" the frantic
   old man seized me violently by the arm and commenced to drag me out of
   the room and down the rickety stairs. He had dropped the candle in his
   panic, but dawn was near, and some faint gray light was filtering in
   through the dust-covered windows. I tripped and stumbled repeatedly,
   but never for a moment would my guide slacken his pace.

   "Run!" he shrieked, "run for your life! You don't know what you've
   done! I never told you the whole thing! There were things I had to
   do—the picture talked to me and told me. I had to guard and keep it—now
   the worst will happen! She and that hair will come up out of their
   graves, for God knows what purpose!

   "Hurry, man! For God's sake let's get out of here while there's time.
   If you have a car, take me along to Cape Girardeau with you. It may get
   me in the end, anywhere, but I'll give it a run for its money. Out of
   here—quick!"

   As we reached the ground floor I became aware of a slow, curious
   thumping from the rear of the house, followed by the sound of a door
   shutting. De Russy had not heard the thumping, but the other noise
   caught his ear and drew from him the most terrible shriek that ever
   sounded in human throat.

   "Oh, God—great God—that was the cellar door—she's coming——"

   By this time I was desperately wrestling with the rusty latch and
   sagging hinges of the great front door—almost as frantic as my host,
   now that I heard the slow, thumping tread approaching from the unknown
   rear rooms of the accursed mansion. The night's rain had warped the
   oaken planks, and the heavy door stuck and resisted even more strongly
   than it had when I forced an entrance the evening before.

   Somewhere a plank creaked beneath the foot of whatever was walking, and
   the sound seemed to snap the last cord of sanity in the poor old man.
   With a roar like that of a maddened bull he released his grip on me and
   made a plunge to the right, through the open door of a room which I
   judged had been a parlor. A second later, just as I got the front door
   open and was making my own escape, I heard the tinkling clatter of
   broken glass and knew he had leapt through a window. And as I bounded
   off the sagging porch to commence my mad race down the long, weed-grown
   drive I thought I could catch the thud of dead, dogged footfalls which
   did not follow me, but which kept leadenly on through the door of the
   cobwebbed parlor.

   I looked backward only twice as I plunged heedlessly through the burrs
   and briars of that abandoned drive, past the dying lindens and
   grotesque scrub-oaks, in the gray pallor of a cloudy November dawn. The
   first time was when an acrid smell overtook me, and I thought of the
   candle de Russy had dropped in the attic studio. By then I was
   comfortably near the road, on the high place from which the roof of the
   distant house was clearly visible above its encircling trees; and just
   as I expected, thick clouds of smoke were billowing out of the attic
   dormers and curling upward into the leaden heavens. I thanked the
   powers of creation that an immemorial curse was about to be purged by
   fire and blotted from the earth.

   But in the next instant came that second backward look in which I
   glimpsed two other things—things that canceled most of the relief and
   gave me a supreme shock from which I shall never recover. I have said
   that I was on a high part of the drive, from which much of the
   plantation behind me was visible. This vista included not only the
   house and its trees but some of the abandoned and partly flooded flat
   land beside the river, and several bends of the weed-choked drive I had
   been so hastily traversing. In both of these latter places I now beheld
   sights—or suspicions of sights—which I wish devoutly I could deny.

   It was a faint, distant scream which made me turn back again, and as I
   did so I caught a trace of motion on the dull gray marshy plain behind
   the house. At that distance human figures are very small; yet I thought
   the motion resolved itself into two of these, pursuer and pursued. I
   even thought I saw the dark-clothed leading figure overtaken and seized
   by the bald, naked figure in the rear—overtaken, seized, and dragged
   violently in the direction of the now burning house.

   But I could not watch the outcome, for at once a nearer sight obtruded
   itself—a suggestion of motion among the underbrush at a point some
   distance back along the deserted drive. Unmistakably, the weeds and
   bushes and briars were swaying as no wind could sway them; swaying as
   if some large, swift serpent were wriggling purposefully along on the
   ground in pursuit of me.
     __________________________________________________________________

   That was all I could stand. I scrambled along madly for the gate,
   heedless of torn clothing and bleeding scratches, and jumped into the
   roadster parked under the great evergreen tree. It was a bedraggled,
   rain-drenched sight, but the works were unharmed and I had no trouble
   in starting the thing. I went on blindly in the direction the car was
   headed for. Nothing was in my mind but to get away from that frightful
   region of nightmares and cacodemons—to get away as quickly and as far
   as gasoline could take me.

   About three or four miles along the road a farmer hailed me—a kindly,
   drawling fellow of middle age and considerable native intelligence. I
   was glad to slow down and ask directions, though I knew I must present
   a strange enough aspect. The man readily told me the way to Cape
   Girardeau, and inquired where I had come from in such a state at such
   an early hour. Thinking it best to say little, I merely mentioned that
   I had been caught in the night's rain and had taken shelter at a
   near-by farmhouse, afterward losing my way in the underbrush trying to
   find my car.

   "At a farmhouse, eh? Wonder whose it coulda ben. Ain't nothin' standin'
   this side o' Jim Ferris' place acrost Barker's Crick, an' that's all o'
   twenty miles by the rud."

   I gave a start, and wondered what fresh mystery this portended, then
   asked my informant if he had overlooked the large ruined plantation
   house whose ancient gate bordered the road not far back.

   "Funny ye sh'd recolleck that, stranger! Musta ben here afore sometime.
   But that house ain't there now. Burnt down five or six years ago—and
   they did tell some queer stories about it."

   I shuddered.

   "You mean Riverside—ol' man de Russy's place. Queer goin's on there
   fifteen or twenty years ago. Ol' man's boy married a gal from abroad,
   and some folks thought she was a mighty odd sort. Didn't like the looks
   of her. Then she and the boy went off sudden, and later on the ol' man
   said he was kilt in the war. But some o' the niggers hinted queer
   things. Got around at last that the ol' fellow fell in love with the
   gal himself and kilt her and the boy. That place was sure enough
   ha'nted by a black snake, mean that what it may.

   "Then five or six years ago the ol' man disappeared and the house
   burned down. Some do say he was burnt up in it. It was a mornin' after
   a rainy night just like this, when lots o' folks heard an awful yellin'
   acrost the fields in ol' de Russy's voice. When they stopped and
   looked, they see the house goin' up in smoke quick as a wink—that place
   was all like tinder anyhow, rain or no rain. Nobody never seen the ol'
   man agin, but onct in a while they tell of the ghost of that big black
   snake glidin' aroun'.

   "What d'you make of it, anyhow? You seem to hev knowed the place.
   Didn't ye ever hear tell of the de Russys? What d'ye reckon was the
   trouble with that gal young Denis married? She kinder made everybody
   shiver and feel hateful, though ye couldn't never tell why."

   I was trying to think, but that process was almost beyond me now. The
   house burned years ago? Then where, and under what conditions, had I
   passed the night? And why did I know what I knew of these things? Even
   as I pondered I saw a hair on my coat sleeve—the short, gray hair of an
   old man.

   In the end I drove on without telling anything. But I did hint that
   gossip was wronging the poor old planter who had suffered so much. I
   made it clear—as if from distant but authentic reports wafted among
   friends—that if anyone was to blame for the trouble at Riverside it was
   the woman, Marceline. She was not suited to Missouri ways, I said, and
   it was too bad that Denis had ever married her.

   More I did not intimate, for I felt that the de Russys, with their
   proudly cherished honor and high, sensitive spirits, would not wish me
   to say more. They had borne enough, God knows, without the countryside
   guessing what a demon of the pit, what a gorgon of the Elder
   blasphemies, had come to flaunt their ancient and stainless name.

   Nor was it right that the neighbors should know that other horror which
   my strange host of the night could not bring himself to tell me—that
   horror which he must have learned as I learned it, from details in the
   lost masterpiece of poor Frank Marsh.

   It would be too hideous if they knew that the one-time heiress of
   Riverside—the accursed gorgon or lamia whose hateful crinkly coil of
   serpent-hair must even now be brooding and twining vampirically around
   an artist's skeleton in a lime-packed grave beneath a charred
   foundation—was faintly, subtly, yet unmistakably the scion of
   Zimbabwe's most primal grovelers. No wonder she owned a link with the
   old witchwoman Sophonisba—for, though in deceitfully slight proportion,
   Marceline was a loathsome, bestial thing, and her forebears had come
   from Africa.

   1.F.

   1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
   effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
   works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
   Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
   electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
   contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
   or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
   intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
   other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot
   be read by your equipment.

   1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
   of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
   Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
   Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
   Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all liability
   to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees. YOU AGREE
   THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF
   WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH
   1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY
   DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL,
   DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF

   receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If the second copy
   is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
   opportunities to fix the problem.

   warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
   If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates
   the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall
   be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted
   by the applicable state law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any

   Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or
   deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

   Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

   Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
   electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
   including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
   because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
   people in all walks of life.

   Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
   assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
   goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain
   freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
   Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
   and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To
   learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and
   how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the
   Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

   Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
   Foundation

   The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
   501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state
   of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue
   Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification number is
   64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
   Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S.
   federal laws and your state’s laws.

   The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
   Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
   date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website and
   official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

   Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
   Literary Archive Foundation

   Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
   public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the
   number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely
   distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of
   equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to
   $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status
   with the IRS.

   The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
   charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
   States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
   considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
   with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
   we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
   DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
   state visit [3]www.gutenberg.org/donate.

   While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
   have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
   against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
   approach us with offers to donate.

   International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
   statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside
   the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

   Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
   methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways
   including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate,
   please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

   Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic
   works

   Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™
   concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
   with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
   Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

   Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
   editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
   the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
   necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
   edition.

   Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility:
   [4]www.gutenberg.org.

   This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including
   how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
   Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to
   our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
