     __________________________________________________________________

   In 1925 I went into Oklahoma looking for snake lore, and I came out
   with a fear of snakes that will last me the rest of my life. I admit it
   is foolish, since there are natural explanations for everything I saw
   and heard, but it masters me none the less. If the old story had been
   all there was to it, I would not have been so badly shaken. My work as
   an American Indian ethnologist has hardened me to all kinds of
   extravagant legendry, and I know that simple white people can beat the
   redskins at their own game when it comes to fanciful inventions. But I
   can't forget what I saw with my own eyes at the insane asylum in
   Guthrie.

   I called at that asylum because a few of the oldest settlers told me I
   would find something important there. Neither Indians nor white men
   would discuss the snake-god legends I had come to trace. The oil-boom
   newcomers, of course, knew nothing of such matters, and the red men and
   old pioneers were plainly frightened when I spoke of them. Not more
   than six or seven people mentioned the asylum, and those who did were
   careful to talk in whispers. But the whisperers said that Dr. McNeill
   could show me a very terrible relic and tell me all I wanted to know.
   He could explain why Yig, the half-human father of serpents, is a
   shunned and feared subject in central Oklahoma, and why old settlers
   shiver at the secret Indian orgies which make the autumn days and
   nights hideous with the ceaseless beating of tom-toms in lonely places.

   It was with the scent of a hound on the trail that I went to Guthrie,
   for I had spent many years collecting data on the evolution of
   serpent-worship among the Indians. I had always felt, from well defined
   undertones of legend and archeology, that great Quetzalcoatl—benign
   snake-god of the Mexicans—had had an older and darker prototype; and
   during recent months I had well-nigh proved it in a series of
   researches stretching from Guatemala to the Oklahoma plains. But
   everything was tantalizing and incomplete, for above the border the
   cult of the snake was hedged about by fear and furtiveness.

   Now it appeared that a new and copious source of data was about to
   dawn, and I sought the head of the asylum with an eagerness I did not
   try to cloak. Dr. McNeill was a small, clean-shaven man of somewhat
   advanced years, and I saw at once from his speech and manner that he
   was a scholar of no mean attainments in many branches outside his
   profession. Grave and doubtful when I first made known my errand, his
   face grew thoughtful as he carefully scanned my credentials and the
   letter of introduction which a kindly old ex-Indian agent had given me.

   "So you've been studying the Yig-legend, eh?" he reflected
   sententiously. "I know that many of our Oklahoma ethnologists have
   tried to connect it with Quetzalcoatl, but I don't think any of them
   have traced the intermediate steps so well. You've done remarkable work
   for a man as young as you seem to be, and you certainly deserve all the
   data we can give.

   "I don't suppose old Major Moore or any of the others told you what it
   is I have here. They don't like to talk about it, and neither do I. It
   is very tragic and very horrible, but that is all. I refuse to consider
   it anything super-natural. There's a story about it that I'll tell you
   after you see it—a devilish sad story, but one that I won't call magic.
   It merely shows the potency that belief has over some people. I'll
   admit there are times when I feel a shiver that's more than physical,
   but in daylight I set all that down to nerves. I'm not a young fellow
   any more, alas!

   "To come to the point, the thing I have is what you might call a victim
   of Yig's curse—a physically living victim. We don't let the bulk of the
   nurses see it, although most of them know it's here. There are just two
   steady old chaps whom I let feed it and clean out its quarters—used to
   be three, but good old Stevens passed on a few years ago. I suppose
   I'll have to break in a new group pretty soon; for the thing doesn't
   seem to age or change much, and we old boys can't last forever. Maybe
   the ethics of the near future will let us give it a merciful release,
   but it's hard to tell.

   "Did you see that single ground-glass basement window over in the east
   wing when you came up the drive? That's where it is. I'll take you
   there myself now. You needn't make any comment. Just look through the
   movable panel in the door and thank God the light isn't any stronger.
   Then I'll tell you the story—or as much as I've been able to piece
   together."

   We walked downstairs very quietly, and did not talk as we threaded the
   corridors of the seemingly deserted basement. Dr. McNeill unlocked a
   gray-painted steel door, but it was only a bulkhead leading to a
   further stretch of hallway. At length he paused before a door marked B
   116, opened a small observation panel which he could use only by
   standing on tiptoe, and pounded several times upon the painted metal,
   as if to arouse the occupant, whatever it might be.

   A faint stench came from the aperture as the doctor unclosed it, and I
   fancied his pounding elicited a kind of low, hissing response. Finally
   he motioned me to replace him at the peep-hole, and I did so with a
   causeless and increasing tremor. The barred, ground-glass window, close
   to the earth outside, admitted only a feeble and uncertain pallor; and
   I had to look into the malodorous den for several seconds before I
   could see what was crawling and wriggling about on the straw-covered
   floor, emitting every now and then a weak and vacuous hiss. Then the
   shadowed outlines began to take shape, and I perceived that the
   squirming entity bore some remote resemblance to a human form laid flat
   on its belly. I clutched at the door-handle for support as I tried to
   keep from fainting.

   The moving object was almost of human size, and entirely devoid of
   clothing. It was absolutely hairless, and its tawny-looking back seemed
   subtly squamous in the dim, ghoulish light. Around the shoulders it was
   rather speckled and brownish, and the head was very curiously flat. As
   it looked up to hiss at me I saw that the beady little black eyes were
   damnably anthropoid, but I could not bear to study them long. They
   fastened themselves on me with a horrible persistence, so that I closed
   the panel gaspingly and left the creature to wriggle about unseen in
   its matted straw and spectral twilight. I must have reeled a bit, for I
   saw that the doctor was gently holding my arm as he guided me away. I
   was stuttering over and over again: "B-but for God's sake, what is it?"
     __________________________________________________________________

   "B-but—for God's sake what is it?"

   Dr. McNeill told me the story in his private office as I sprawled
   opposite him in an easy-chair. The gold and crimson of late afternoon
   changed to the violet of early dusk, but still I sat awed and
   motionless. I resented every ring of the telephone and every whir of
   the buzzer, and I could have cursed the nurses and interns whose knocks
   now and then summoned the doctor briefly to the outer office. Night
   came, and I was glad my host switched on all the lights. Scientist
   though I was, my zeal for research was half forgotten amid such
   breathless ecstasies of fright as a small boy might feel when whispered
   witch-tales go the rounds of the chimney-corner.
     __________________________________________________________________

   It seems that Yig, the snake-god of the central plains
   tribes—presumably the primal source of the more southerly Quetzalcoatl
   or Kukulcan—was an odd, half-anthropomorphic devil of highly arbitrary
   and capricious nature. He was not wholly evil, and was usually quite
   well-disposed toward those who gave proper respect to him and his
   children, the serpents; but in the autumn he became abnormally
   ravenous, and had to be driven away by means of suitable rites. That
   was why the tom-toms in the Pawnee, Wichita, and Caddo country pounded
   ceaselessly week in and week out in August, September, and October; and
   why the medicine-men made strange noises with rattles and whistles
   curiously like those of the Aztecs and Mayas.

   Yig's chief trait was a relentless devotion to his children—a devotion
   so great that the redskins almost feared to protect themselves from the
   venomous rattlesnakes which thronged the region. Frightful clandestine
   tales hinted of his vengeance upon mortals who flouted him or wreaked
   harm upon his wriggling progeny; his chosen method being to turn his
   victim, after suitable tortures, to a spotted snake.

   In the old days of the Indian Territory, the doctor went on, there was
   not quite so much secrecy about Yig. The plains tribes, less cautious
   than the desert nomads and Pueblos, talked quite freely of their
   legends and autumn ceremonies with the first Indian agents, and let
   considerable of the lore spread out through the neighboring regions of
   white settlement. The great fear came in the land-rush days of
   'eighty-nine, when some extraordinary incidents had been rumored, and
   the rumors sustained, by what seemed to be hideously tangible proofs.
   Indians said that the new white men did not know how to get on with
   Yig, and afterward the settlers came to take that theory at face value.
   Now no old-timer in middle Oklahoma, white or red, could be induced to
   breathe a word about the snake-god except in vague hints. Yet after
   all, the doctor added with almost needless emphasis, the only truly
   authenticated horror had been a thing of pitiful tragedy rather than of
   bewitchment. It was all very material and cruel—even that last phase
   which had caused so much dispute.

   Dr. McNeill paused and cleared his throat before getting down to his
   special story, and I felt a tingling sensation as when a theater
   curtain rises. The thing had begun when Walker Davis and his wife
   Audrey left Arkansas to settle in the newly opened public lands in the
   spring of 1889, and the end had come in the country of the
   Wichitas—north of the Washita River, in what is at present Caddo
   County. There is a small village called Binger there now, and the
   railway goes through; but otherwise the place is less changed than
   other parts of Oklahoma. It is still a section of farms and
   ranches—quite productive in these days—since the great oil-fields do
   not come very close.

   Walker and Audrey had come from Franklin County in the Ozarks with a
   canvas-topped wagon, two mules, an ancient and useless dog called
   "Wolf," and all their household goods. They were typical hill-folk,
   youngish and perhaps a little more ambitious than most, and looked
   forward to a life of better returns for their hard work than they had
   had in Arkansas. Both were lean, rawboned specimens; the man tall,
   sandy and gray-eyed, and the woman short and rather dark, with a black
   straightness of hair suggesting a slight Indian admixture.

   In general, there was very little of distinction about them, and but
   for one thing their annals might not have differed from those of
   thousands of other pioneers who flocked into the new country at that
   time. That thing was Walker's almost epileptic fear of snakes, which
   some laid to prenatal causes, and some said came from a dark prophecy
   about his end with which an old Indian squaw had tried to scare him
   when he was small. Whatever the cause, the effect was marked indeed;
   for despite his strong general courage the very mention of a snake
   would cause him to grow faint and pale, while the sight of even a tiny
   specimen would produce a shock sometimes bordering on a convulsion
   seizure.

   The Davises started out early in the year, in the hope of being on
   their new land for the spring plowing. Travel was slow; for the roads
   were bad in Arkansas, while in the Territory there were great stretches
   of rolling hills and red, sandy barrens without any roads whatever. As
   the terrain grew flatter, the change from their native mountains
   depressed them more, perhaps, than they realized; but they found the
   people at the Indian agencies very affable, while most of the settled
   Indians seemed friendly and civil. Now and then they encountered a
   fellow-pioneer, with whom crude pleasantries and expressions of amiable
   rivalry were generally exchanged.

   Owing to the season, there were not many snakes in evidence, so Walker
   did not suffer from his special temperamental weakness. In the earlier
   stages of the journey, too, there were no Indian snake-legends to
   trouble him; for the transplanted tribes from the southeast do not
   share the wilder beliefs of their western neighbors. As fate would have
   it, it was a white man at Okmulgee in the Creek country who gave the
   Davises the first hint of the Yig beliefs; a hint which had a curiously
   fascinating effect on Walker, and caused him to ask questions very
   freely after that.

   Before long Walker's fascination had developed into a bad case of
   fright. He took the most extraordinary precautions at each of the
   nightly camps, always clearing away whatever vegetation he found, and
   avoiding stony places whenever he could. Every clump of stunted bushes
   and every cleft in the great, slab-like rocks seemed to him now to hide
   malevolent serpents, while every human figure not obviously part of a
   settlement or emigrant train seemed to him a potential snake-god till
   nearness had proved the contrary. Fortunately no troublesome encounters
   came at this stage to shake his nerves still further.

   As they approached the Kickapoo country they found it harder and harder
   to avoid camping near rocks. Finally it was no longer possible, and
   poor Walker was reduced to the puerile expedient of droning some of the
   rustic anti-snake charms he had learned in his boyhood. Two or three
   times a snake was really glimpsed, and these sights did not help the
   sufferer in his efforts to preserve composure.
     __________________________________________________________________

   On the twenty-second evening of the journey a savage wind made it
   imperative, for the sake of the mules, to camp in as sheltered a spot
   as possible; and Audrey persuaded her husband to take advantage of a
   cliff which rose uncommonly high above the dried bed of a former
   tributary of the Canadian River. He did not like the rocky cast of the
   place, but allowed himself to be overruled this once; leading the
   animals sullenly toward the protecting slope, which the nature of the
   ground would not allow the wagon to approach.

   Audrey, examining the rocks near the wagon, meanwhile noticed a
   singular sniffing on the part of the feeble old dog. Seizing a rifle,
   she followed his lead, and presently thanked her stars that she had
   forestalled Walker in her discovery. For there, snugly nested in the
   gap between two boulders, was a sight it would have done him no good to
   see. Visible only as one convoluted expanse, but perhaps comprising as
   many as three or four separate units, was a mass of lazy wriggling
   which could not be other than a brood of new-born rattlesnakes.

   Anxious to save Walker from a trying shock, Audrey did not hesitate to
   act, but took the gun firmly by the barrel and brought the butt down
   again and again upon the writhing objects. Her own sense of loathing
   was great, but it did not amount to a real fear. Finally she saw that
   her task was done, and turned to cleanse the improvised bludgeon in the
   red sand and dry, dead grass near by. She must, she reflected, cover
   the nest up before Walker got back from tethering the mules. Old Wolf,
   tottering relic of mixed shepherd and coyote ancestry that he was, had
   vanished, and she feared he had gone to fetch his master.

   Footsteps at that instant proved her fear well founded. A second more,
   and Walker had seen everything. Audrey made a move to catch him if he
   should faint, but he did no more than sway. Then the look of pure
   fright on his bloodless face turned slowly to something like mingled
   awe and anger, and he began to upbraid his wife in trembling tones.

   "Gawd's sake, Aud, but why'd ye go for to do that? Hain't ye heerd all
   the things they've ben tellin' about this snake-devil Yig? Ye'd ought
   to a told me, and we'd a moved on. Don't ye know they's a devil-god
   what gets even if ye hurts his children? What for d'ye think the Injuns
   all dances and beats their drums in the fall about? This land's under a
   curse, I tell ye—nigh every soul we've a-talked to sence we come in's
   said the same. Yig rules here, an' he comes out every fall for to git
   his victims and turn 'em into snakes. Why, Aud, they won't none of them
   Injuns acrost the Canayjin kill a snake for love nor money!

   "Gawd knows what ye done to yourself, gal, a-stompin' out a hull brood
   o' Yig's chillen. He'll git ye, sure, sooner er later, unlessen I kin
   buy a charm offen some o' the Injun medicine-men. He'll git ye, Aud, as
   sure's they's a Gawd in heaven—he'll come outa the night and turn ye
   into a crawlin' spotted snake!"

   All the rest of the journey Walker kept up the frightened reproofs and
   prophecies. They crossed the Canadian near Newcastle, and soon
   afterward met with the first of the real plains Indians they had seen—a
   party of blanketed Wichitas, whose leader talked freely under the spell
   of the whisky offered him, and taught poor Walker a long-winded
   protective charm against Yig in exchange for a quart bottle of the same
   inspiring fluid. By the end of the week the chosen site in the Wichita
   country was reached, and the Davises made haste to trace their
   boundaries and perform the spring plowing before even beginning the
   construction of a cabin.

   The region was flat, drearily windy, and sparse of natural vegetation,
   but promised great fertility under cultivation. Occasional outcroppings
   of granite diversified a soil of decomposed red sandstone, and here and
   there a great flat rock would stretch along the surface of the ground
   like a man-made floor. There seemed to be very few snakes, or possible
   dens for them, so Audrey at last persuaded Walker to build the one-room
   cabin over a vast, smooth slab of exposed stone. With such a flooring
   and with a good-sized fireplace the wettest weather might be
   defied—though it soon became evident that dampness was no salient
   quality of the district. Logs were hauled in the wagon from the nearest
   belt of woods, many miles toward the Wichita Mountains.

   Walker built his wide-chimneyed cabin and crude barn with the aid of
   some of the other settlers, though the nearest one was over a mile
   away. In turn, he helped his helpers at similar house-raisings, so that
   many ties of friendship sprang up between the new neighbors. There was
   no town worthy the name nearer than El Reno, on the railway thirty
   miles or more to the northeast; and before many weeks had passed, the
   people of the section had become very cohesive despite the wideness of
   their scattering. The Indians, a few of whom had begun to settle down
   on ranches, were for the most part harmless, though somewhat
   quarrelsome when fired by the liquid stimulation which found its way to
   them despite all government bans.

   Of all the neighbors the Davises found Joe and Sally Compton, who
   likewise hailed from Arkansas, the most helpful and congenial. Sally is
   still alive, known now as Grandma Compton; and her son Clyde, then an
   infant in arms, has become one of the leading men of the state. Sally
   and Audrey used to visit each other often, for their cabins were only
   two miles apart; and in the long spring and summer afternoons they
   exchanged many a tale of old Arkansas and many a rumor about the new
   country.

   Sally was very sympathetic about Walker's weakness regarding snakes,
   but perhaps did more to aggravate than cure the parallel nervousness
   which Audrey was acquiring through his incessant praying and
   prophesying about the curse of Yig. She was uncommonly full of gruesome
   snake stories, and produced a direfully strong impression with her
   acknowledged masterpiece—the tale of a man in Scott County who had been
   bitten by a whole horde of rattlers at once, and had swelled so
   monstrously from poison that his body had finally burst with a pop.
   Needless to say, Audrey did not repeat this anecdote to her husband,
   and she implored the Comptons to beware of starting it on the rounds of
   the countryside. It is to Joe's and Sally's credit that they heeded
   this plea with the utmost fidelity.

   Walker did his corn-planting early, and in midsummer improved his time
   by harvesting a fair crop of the native grass of the region. With the
   help of Joe Compton he dug a well which gave a moderate supply of very
   good water, though he planned to sink an artesian later on. He did not
   run into many serious snake scares, and made his land as inhospitable
   as possible for wriggling visitors. Every now and then he rode over to
   the cluster of thatched conical huts which formed the main village of
   the Wichitas, and talked long with the old men and shamans about the
   snake-god and how to nullify his wrath. Charms were always ready in
   exchange for whisky, but much of the information he got was far from
   reassuring.

   Yig was a great god. He was bad medicine. He did not forget things. In
   the autumn his children were hungry and wild, and Yig was hungry and
   wild, too. All the tribes made medicine against Yig when the corn
   harvest came. They gave him some corn, and danced in proper regalia to
   the sound of whistle, rattle, and drum. They kept the drums pounding to
   drive Yig away, and called down the aid of Tiráwa, whose children men
   are, even as the snakes are Yig's children. It was bad that the squaw
   of Davis killed the children of Yig. Let Davis say the charms many
   times when the corn harvest comes. Yig is Yig. Yig is a great god.

   By the time the corn harvest did come, Walker had succeeded in getting
   his wife into a deplorably jumpy state. His prayers and borrowed
   incantations came to be a nuisance; and when the autumn rites of the
   Indians began, there was always a distant wind-borne pounding of
   tom-toms to lend an added background of the sinister. It was maddening
   to have the muffled clatter always stealing over the wide red plains.
   Why would it never stop? Day and night, week on week, it was always
   going in exhaustless relays, as persistently as the red dusty winds
   that carried it. Audrey loathed it more than her husband did, for he
   saw in it a compensating element of protection. It was with this sense
   of a mighty, intangible bulwark against evil that he got in his corn
   crop and prepared cabin and stable for the coming winter.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The autumn was abnormally warm, and except for their primitive cookery
   the Davises found scant use for the stone fireplace Walker had built
   with such care. Something in the unnaturalness of the hot dust-clouds
   preyed on the nerves of all the settlers, but most of all on Audrey's
   and Walker's. The notions of a hovering snake-curse and the weird,
   endless rhythm of the distant Indian drums formed a bad combination
   which any added element of the bizarre went far to render utterly
   unendurable.

   Notwithstanding this strain, several festive gatherings were held at
   one or another of the cabins after the crops were reaped: keeping
   naively alive in modernity those curious rites of the harvest-home
   which are as old as human agriculture itself. Lafayette Smith, who came
   from southern Missouri and had a cabin about three miles east of
   Walker's, was a very passable fiddler; and his tunes did much to make
   the celebrants forget the monotonous beating of the distant tom-toms.
   Then Hallowe'en drew near, and the settlers planned another frolic—this
   time, had they but known it, of a lineage older than even agriculture:
   the dread Witch-Sabbath of the primal pre-Aryans, kept alive through
   ages in the midnight blackness of secret woods, and still hinting at
   vague terrors under its latter-day mask of comedy and lightness.
   Hallowe'en was to fall on a Thursday, and the neighbors agreed to
   gather for their first revel at the Davis cabin.

   It was on that thirty-first of October that the warm spell broke. The
   morning was gray and leaden, and by noon the incessant winds had
   changed from searingness to rawness. People shivered all the more
   because they were not prepared for the chill, and Walker Davis's old
   dog Wolf dragged himself wearily indoors to a place beside the hearth.
   But the distant drums still thumped on, nor were the white citizenry
   less inclined to pursue their chosen rites. As early as four in the
   afternoon the wagons began to arrive at Walker's cabin; and in the
   evening, after a memorable barbecue, Lafayette Smith's fiddle inspired
   a very fair-sized company to great feats of saltatory grotesqueness in
   the one good-sized but crowded room. The younger folk indulged in the
   amiable inanities proper to the season, and now and then old Wolf would
   howl with doleful and spine-tickling ominousness at some especially
   spectral strain from Lafayette's squeaky violin—a device he had never
   heard before. Mostly, though, this battered veteran slept through the
   merriment; for he was past the age of active interests and lived
   largely in his dreams. Tom and Jennie Rigby had brought their collie
   Zeke along, but the canines did not fraternize. Zeke seemed strangely
   uneasy over something, and nosed around curiously all the evening.

   Audrey and Walker made a fine couple on the floor, and Grandma Compton
   still likes to recall her impression of their dancing that night. Their
   worries seemed forgotten for the nonce, and Walker was shaved and
   trimmed into a surprizing degree of spruceness. By ten o'clock all
   hands were healthily tired, and the guests began to depart family by
   family with many handshakings and bluff assurances of what a fine time
   everybody had had. Tom and Jennie thought Zeke's eery howls as he
   followed them to their wagon were marks of regret at having to go home;
   though Audrey said it must be the far-away tom-toms which annoyed him,
   for the distant thumping was surely ghastly enough after the merriment
   within.

   The night was bitterly cold, and for the first time Walker put a great
   log in the fireplace and banked it with ashes to keep it smoldering
   till morning. Old Wolf dragged himself within the ruddy glow and lapsed
   into his customary coma. Audrey and Walker, too tired to think of
   charms or curses, tumbled into the rough pine bed and were asleep
   before the cheap alarm-clock on the mantle had ticked out three
   minutes. And from far away, the rhythmic pounding of those hellish
   tom-toms still pulsed on the chill night-wind.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Dr. McNeill paused here and removed his glasses, as if a blurring of
   the objective world might make the reminiscent vision clearer. "You'll
   soon appreciate," he said, "that I had a great deal of difficulty in
   piecing out all that happened after the guests left. There were times,
   though—at first—when I was able to make a try at it." After a moment of
   silence he went on with the tale.

   Audrey had terrible dreams of Yig, who appeared to her in the guise of
   Satan as depicted in cheap engravings she had seen. It was, indeed,
   from an absolute ecstasy of nightmare that she started suddenly awake
   to find Walker already conscious and sitting up in bed. He seemed to be
   listening intently to something, and silenced her with a whisper when
   she began to ask what had roused him.

   "Hark, Aud!" he breathed. "Don't ye hear somethin' a-singin' and
   buzzin' and rustlin'? D'ye reckon it's the fall crickets?"

   Certainly, there was distinctly audible within the cabin such a sound
   as he had described. Audrey tried to analyze it, and was impressed with
   some element at once horrible and familiar, which hovered just outside
   the rim of her memory. And beyond it all, waking a hideous thought, the
   monotonous beating of the distant tom-toms came incessantly across the
   black plains on which a cloudy half-moon had set.

   "Walker—s'pose it's—the—the—curse o' Yig?"

   She could feel him tremble.

   "No, gal, I don't reckon he comes thataway. He's shapen like a man,
   except ye look at him clost. That's what Chief Gray Eagle says. This
   here's some varmints come in outen the cold—not crickets, I calc'late,
   but summat like 'em. I'd orter git up and' stomp 'em out afore they
   make much headway or git at the cupboard."

   He rose, felt for the lantern that hung within easy reach, and rattled
   the tin match-box nailed to the wall beside it. Audrey sat up in bed
   and watched the flare of the match grow into the steady glow of the
   lantern. Then, as their eyes began to take in the whole of the room,
   the crude rafters shook with the frenzy of their simultaneous shriek.
   For the flat, rocky floor, revealed in the new-born illumination, was
   one seething brown-speckled mass of wriggling rattlesnakes, slithering
   toward the fire, and even now turning their loathsome heads to menace
   the fright-blasted lantern-bearer.

   It was only for an instant that Audrey saw the things. The reptiles
   were of every size, of uncountable numbers, and apparently of several
   varieties; and even as she looked, two or three of them reared their
   heads as if to strike at Walker. She did not faint—it was Walker's
   crash to the floor that extinguished the lantern and plunged her into
   blackness. He had not screamed a second time—fright had paralyzed him,
   and he fell as if shot by a silent arrow from no mortal's bow. To
   Audrey the entire world seemed to whirl about fantastically, mingling
   with the nightmare from which she had started.

   Voluntary motion of any sort was impossible, for will and the sense of
   reality had left her. She fell back inertly on her pillow, hoping that
   she would wake soon. No actual sense of what had happened penetrated
   her mind for some time. Then, little by little, the suspicion that she
   was really awake began to dawn on her; and she was convulsed with a
   mounting blend of panic and grief which made her long to shriek out
   despite the inhibiting spell which kept her mute.

   Walker was gone, and she had not been able to help him. He had died of
   snakes, just as the old witch-woman had predicted when he was a little
   boy. Poor Wolf had not been able to help, either—probably he had not
   even awaked from his senile stupor. And now the crawling things must be
   coming for her, writhing closer and closer every moment in the dark,
   perhaps even now twining slipperily about the bed-posts and oozing up
   over the coarse woolen blankets. Unconsciously she crept under the
   clothes and trembled.

   It must be the curse of Yig. He had sent his monstrous children on
   All-Hallows' Night, and they had taken Walker first. Why was
   that—wasn't he innocent enough? Why not come straight for her—hadn't
   she killed those little rattlers alone? Then she thought of the curse's
   form as told by the Indians. She wouldn't be killed—just turned to a
   spotted snake. Ugh! So she would be like those things she had glimpsed
   on the floor—those things which Yig had sent to get her and enroll her
   among their number! She tried to mumble a charm that Walker had taught
   her, but found she could not utter a single sound.

   The noisy ticking of the alarm-clock sounded above the maddening beat
   of the distant tom-toms. The snakes were taking a long time—did they
   mean to delay on purpose to play on her nerves? Every now and then she
   thought she felt a stealthy, insidious pressure on the bedclothes, but
   each time it turned out to be only the automatic twitchings of her
   overwrought nerves. The clock ticked on in the dark, and a change came
   slowly over her thoughts.

   Those snakes couldn't have taken so long! They couldn't be Yig's
   messengers after all, but just natural rattlers that were nested below
   the rock and had been drawn there by the fire. They weren't coming for
   her, perhaps—perhaps they had sated themselves on poor Walker. Where
   were they now? Gone? Coiled by the fire? Still crawling over the prone
   corpse of their victim? The clock ticked, and the distant drums
   throbbed on.

   At the thought of her husband's body lying there in the pitch blackness
   a thrill of purely physical horror passed over Audrey. That story of
   Sally Compton's about the man back in Scott County! He, too, had been
   bitten by a whole bunch of rattlesnakes, and what had happened to him?
   The poison had rotted the flesh and swelled the whole corpse, and in
   the end the bloated thing had burst horribly—burst horribly with a
   detestable popping noise. Was that what was happening to Walker down
   there on the rock floor? Instinctively she felt that she had begun to
   listen for something too terrible even to name to herself.

   The clock ticked on, keeping a kind of mocking, sardonic time with the
   far-off drumming that the night-wind brought. She wished it were a
   striking clock, so that she could know how long this eldritch vigil
   must last. She cursed the toughness of fiber that kept her from
   fainting, and wondered what sort of relief the dawn could bring, after
   all. Probably neighbors would pass—no doubt somebody would call—would
   they find her still sane? Was she still sane now?

   Morbidly listening, Audrey all at once became aware of something which
   she had to verify with every effort of her will before she could
   believe it; and which, once verified, she did not know whether to
   welcome or dread. The distant beating of the Indian tom-toms had
   ceased. They had always maddened her—but had not Walker regarded them
   as a bulwark against nameless evil from outside the universe? What were
   some of those things he had repeated to her in whispers after talking
   with Gray Eagle and the Wichita medicine-men?

   She did not relish this new and sudden silence, after all! There was
   something sinister about it. The loud-ticking clock seemed abnormal in
   its new loneliness. Capable at last of conscious motion, she shook the
   covers from her face and looked into the darkness toward the window. It
   must have cleared after the moon set, for she saw the square aperture
   distinctly against the background of stars.

   Then without warning came that shocking, unutterable sound—ugh!—that
   dull, putrid pop of cleft skin and escaping poison in the dark.
   God!—Sally's story—that obscene stench, and this gnawing, clawing
   silence! It was too much. The bonds of muteness snapped, and the black
   night waxed reverberant with Audrey's screams of stark unbridled
   frenzy.

   Consciousness did not pass away with the shock. How merciful if only it
   had! Amidst the echoes of her shrieking Audrey still saw the
   star-sprinkled square of window ahead, and heard the doom-boding
   ticking of that frightful clock. Did she hear another sound? Was that
   square window still a perfect square? She was in no condition to weigh
   the evidence of her senses or distinguish between fact and
   hallucination.

   No—that window was not a perfect square. Something had encroached on
   the lower edge. Nor was the ticking of the clock the only sound in the
   room. There was, beyond dispute, a heavy breathing neither her own nor
   poor Wolf's. Wolf slept very silently, and his wakeful wheezing was
   unmistakable. Then Audrey saw against the stars the black, demoniac
   silhouette of something anthropoid—the undulant bulk of a gigantic head
   and shoulders fumbling slowly toward her.

   "Y'aaaah! Y'aaaah! Go away! Go away! Go away, snake-devil! Go 'way,
   Yig! I didn't want to kill 'em—I was feared he'd be scairt of 'em.
   Don't, Yig, don't! I didn't go for to hurt yore chillen—don't come nigh
   me—don't change me into no spotted snake!"

   But the half-formless head and shoulders only lurched onward toward the
   bed, very silently.

   Everything snapped at once inside Audrey's head, and in a second she
   had turned from a cowering child to a raging madwoman. She knew where
   the ax was—hung against the wall on those pegs near the lantern. It was
   within easy reach, and she could find it in the dark. Before she was
   conscious of anything further it was in her hands, and she was creeping
   toward the foot of the bed—toward the monstrous head and shoulders that
   every moment groped their way nearer. Had there been any light, the
   look on her face would not have been pleasant to see.

   "Take that, you! And that, and that, and that!"

   She was laughing shrilly now, and her cackles mounted higher as she saw
   that the starlight beyond the window was yielding to the dim prophetic
   pallor of coming dawn.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Dr. McNeill wiped the perspiration from his forehead and put on his
   glasses again. I waited for him to resume, and as he kept silent I
   spoke softly.

   "She lived? She was found? Was it ever explained?"

   The doctor cleared his throat.

   "Yes—she lived, in a way. And it was explained. I told you there was no
   bewitchment—only cruel, pitiful, material horror."

   It was Sally Compton who had made the discovery. She had ridden over to
   the Davis cabin the next afternoon to talk over the party with Audrey,
   and had seen no smoke from the chimney. That was queer. It had turned
   very warm again, yet Audrey was usually cooking something at that hour.
   The mules were making hungry-sounding noises in the barn, and there was
   no sign of old Wolf sunning himself in the accustomed spot by the door.

   Altogether, Sally did not like the look of the place, so was very timid
   and hesitant as she dismounted and knocked. She got no answer, but
   waited some time before trying the crude door of split logs. The lock,
   it appeared, was unfastened; and she slowly pushed her way in. Then,
   perceiving what was there, she reeled back, gasped, and clung to the
   jamb to preserve her balance.

   A terrible odor had welled out as she opened the door, but that was not
   what had stunned her. It was what she had seen. For within that shadowy
   cabin monstrous things had happened and three shocking objects remained
   on the floor to awe and baffle the beholder.

   Near the burned-out fireplace was the great dog—purple decay on the
   skin left bare by mange and old age, and the whole carcass burst by the
   puffing effect of rattlesnake poison. It must have been bitten by a
   veritable legion of the reptiles.

   To the right of the door was the ax-hacked remnant of what had been a
   man—clad in a nightshirt, and with the shattered bulk of a lantern
   clenched in one hand. He was totally free from any sign of snake-bite.
   Near him lay the ensanguined ax, carelessly discarded.

   And wriggling flat on the floor was a loathsome, vacant-eyed thing that
   had been a woman, but was now only a mute, mad caricature. All that
   this thing could do was to hiss, and hiss, and hiss.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Both the doctor and I were brushing cold drops from our foreheads by
   this time. He poured something from a flask on his desk, took a nip,
   and handed another glass to me. I could only suggest tremulously and
   stupidly:

   "So Walker had only fainted that first time—the screams roused him, and
   the ax did the rest?"

   "Yes." Dr. McNeill's voice was low. "But he met his death from snakes
   just the same. It was his fear working in two ways—it made him faint,
   and it made him fill his wife with the wild stories that caused her to
   strike out when she thought she saw the snake-devil."

   I thought for a moment.

   "And Audrey—wasn't it queer how the curse of Yig seemed to work itself
   out on her? I suppose the impression of hissing snakes had been fairly
   ground into her."

   "Yes. There were lucid spells at first, but they got to be fewer and
   fewer. Her hair came white at the roots as it grew, and later began to
   fall out. The skin grew blotchy, and when she died——"

   I interrupted with a start.

   "Died? Then what was that—that thing downstairs?"

   McNeill spoke gravely.

   "That is what was born to her three-quarters of a year afterward. There
   were three more of them—two were even worse—but this is the only, one
   that lived."

   Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

   Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
   electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
   including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
   because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
   people in all walks of life.

   Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
   assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
   goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain
   freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
   Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
   and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To
   learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and
   how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the
   Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

   Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
   Foundation

   The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
   501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state
   of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue
   Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification number is
   64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
   Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S.
   federal laws and your state’s laws.

   official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

   Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
   Literary Archive Foundation

   Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
   public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the
   number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely
   distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of
   equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to
   $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status
   with the IRS.

   The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
   charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
   States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
   considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
   with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
   we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
   DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
   state visit [3]www.gutenberg.org/donate.

   While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
   have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
   against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
   approach us with offers to donate.

   International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
   statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside
   the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

   Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
   methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways
   including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate,
   please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

   Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic
   works

   Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™
   concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
   with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
   Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

   Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
   editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
   the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
